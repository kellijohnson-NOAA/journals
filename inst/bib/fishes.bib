  abstract =     "In a greater study of the recent fossil Gadidae, the
                 object of this paper is to better define the
                 trisopterine species and their relationships. The
                 taxonomy of the four recent species usually included in
                 the genus Trisopterus is further elaborated by means of
                 published and new data on their otoliths, by published
                 data on general external features and meristics of the
                 fishes, and their genetics. Fossil otoliths, from the
                 beginning of the Oligocene up to the present, reveal
                 much of their evolution and throw more light on their
                 relationships. Several succeeding and partly
                 overlapping lineages representing different genera are
                 recognized during this time interval. The genus
                 Neocolliolus Gaemers, 1976, for \bioname{Trisopterus
                 esmarkii} (Nilsson, 1855), is more firmly based. A new
                 genus, Allotrisopterus, is introduced for
                 \bioname{Trisopterus minutus} (Linnaeus, 1758). The
                 similarity with \bioname{Trisopterus capelanus}
                 (Lacep{\`e}de, 1800) is an example of convergent
                 evolution. The tribe Trisopterini Endo (2002) should
                 only contain Trisopterus, Allotrisopterus and
                 Neocolliolus as recent genera. Correct identification
                 of otoliths from fisheries research and from sea bottom
                 samples extends the knowledge of the present day
                 geographical distribution of T. capelanus and T. luscus
                 (Linnaeus, 1758). T. capelanus is also living along the
                 Atlantic coast of Portugal and at least up to and
                 including the R{\'\i}a de Arosa, Galicia, Spain. There
                 it can easily be mistaken for A. minutus that is also
                 living there. Otoliths of T. luscus have been
                 identified from the Evvo{\"\i}k{\'o}s Channel between
                 Euboia and the mainland of Greece, thus it must live
                 also in the Aegean Sea. Otoliths prove to be a powerful
                 tool in taxonomy, biogeography and evolution of
                 teleosts.",

                 The lipid and fatty acid profiles of White Sea herring
                 in Dvina, Kandalaksha, and Onega bays, and in the
                 waters of Tersky Shore (the mouth of the Varzuga River)
                 in autumn (after the fattening period) were studied.
                 Different methods --- thin-layer, high-performance
                 liquid and gas chromatography --- were used for this
                 purpose. Determined heterogeneity on studied parameters
                 of lipid metabolism of fish from different habitats is
                 associated with differences in trophic and hydrological
                 conditions in these bays. Variations of lipid
                 compositions of herring groups can be a reflection of
                 qualitative and quantitative strategies of biochemical
                 adaptations, aimed at compensating the lipid metabolism

                 50 g KCl kg \minus 1 for 6 days affected feed intake
                 and survival of fish transferred immediately from
                 estuarine water to KDSGW of the equivalent salinity (20
                 g\cdotp L \minus 1). Experiment 2 (Exp. 2) investigated
                 whether an aquafeed fortified with zero, 10, or 25 g
                 KCl kg \minus 1 affected survival, feed intake, and

                 estuarine water (20 g\cdotp L \minus 1). The results of
                 Exp. 1 demonstrated there was no benefit of fortifying
                 aquafeed with KCl; fish transferred into KDSGW stopped
                 feeding and developed symptoms akin to tetany. Some
                 individuals also died and others became moribund. Exp.
                 1 was terminated according to animal care and ethics
                 guidelines. The results of Exp. 2 indicated the amount
                 of KCl added to the aquafeed did not affect survival,
                 feed intake, or food conversion ratio (FCR) of snapper,
                 irrespective of water treatment. However, SGR and FCR
                 was better when fish were reared in normal estuarine
                 water and KDSGW fortified to have 100\% the [K + ] of
                 equivalent salinity estuarine water. Our results
                 demonstrated that juvenile snapper were unable to
                 utilize the KCl added to the aquafeed and were probably
                 reliant on sequestering K + ions from the water column
                 in order to maintain functions involving hydromineral
                 homeostasis. Fortification of aquafeeds with KCl does
                 not ameliorate the negative effects of KDSWG on the

                 aquafeed with KCl; fish transferred into KDSGW stopped
                 feeding and developed symptoms akin to tetany. Some
                 individuals also died and others became moribund. Exp.
                 1 was terminated according to animal care and ethics
                 guidelines. The results of Exp. 2 indicated the amount
                 of KCl added to the aquafeed did not affect survival,
                 feed intake, or food conversion ratio (FCR) of snapper,
                 irrespective of water treatment. However, SGR and FCR
                 was better when fish were reared in normal estuarine
                 water and KDSGW fortified to have 100\% the [K + ] of
                 equivalent salinity estuarine water. Our results
                 demonstrated that juvenile snapper were unable to
                 utilize the KCl added to the aquafeed and were probably
                 reliant on sequestering K + ions from the water column
                 in order to maintain functions involving hydromineral
                 homeostasis. Fortification of aquafeeds with KCl does
                 not ameliorate the negative effects of KDSWG on the
                 survival of juvenile snapper.",

                 (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation (PAF-antagonists) or
                 to induce platelet aggregation (PAF-agonists), since
                 PAF plays a crucial role in the initiation and
                 development of atherosclerosis. This study focused on
                 the polar lipids since previous studies have underlined
                 that the antithrombotic properties of foodstuffs are
                 mainly attributed to polar lipid micro-constituents.
                 TPL of sardine fillet induced platelet aggregation,
                 while TPL of cod liver had a bimodal effect on
                 platelets. TLC polar lipid fractions of both samples
                 exhibited in vitro aggregatory and inhibitory activity
                 towards platelets. However, TLC sardine polar lipid
                 fractions showed stronger in vitro antithrombotic
                 activities than the cod liver oil ones. These data
                 constitute evidence of the putative contribution of
                 fish polar lipids against cardiovascular diseases,
                 underling firstly the beneficial effect of fish and
                 fish lipids as functional foodstuffs against
                 atherogenesis and secondly the more important role of

                 (five days post-hatching, 2.1 mm average notochordal
                 length) were assessed for growth, survival, degree of

                 the 28\% S diet, and these larvae also had the highest
                 lipase, amylase and glucosidase activities (0.28, 0.56

                 spawning and potential fishing ground for tuna species.
                 However, few studies have been conducted on this area.
                 In this paper, the environmental preference of bigeye
                 tuna was assessed based on catch data and three main
                 environmental satellite data; namely; sea surface
                 temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll (SSC), and
                 sea surface height deviation (SSHD). Then, the
                 relationship between bigeye tuna catches and
                 environmental satellite data was analyzed by using a
                 simplified method of the Generalized Additive Model
                 (GAM) which is called scatterplot smoothers. This
                 method is the forerunner of GAM and has not yet been

                 characteristics of low SST, low SSC, and low positive
                 SSHD as well as areas with extreme SSHD values, which

                 was designed using mixture model. The inclusion level

                 60\%. Remaining 40\% comprised of basal ingredients
                 kept constant for all 10 feeds. African catfish of
                 average initial weight 35.2 \pm 0.9 g were fed with one
                 of the treatment diets for 28 days. The protein:lipid

                 evaluating the feed utilization and growth of the fish.
                 We found that catfish performances were mainly
                 depending on ingredients and not the ratio itself. The
                 protein:lipid ratios in the diets made of plant
                 ingredients were high but SGR was low. Specific growth

                 but ca. 2\% day\minus 1 at both 60\% BNM and 60\% SBM
                 diets. SGR was similar (3.5\% day\minus 1) with diets
                 of 30\% BNM or SBM inclusion with 30\% FM. Feed
                 conversion ratio increased from below 0.6 of the 60\%
                 FM diet up to 1.5 (60\% SBM) and 1.7 (60\% BNM).
                 Protein efficiency ratio decreased linearly with
                 increasing FM substitution, but protein productive
                 value (PPV) was similar for catfish fed 60\% FM diet
                 and its 50\% substitution with BNM or SBM. These
                 results suggest that protein:lipid ratio cannot be used

                 could be attributed to the change of shark behavior or
                 the trypanorhynch host path. The relationship between
                 the trypanorhynch assemblage and factors for
                 carcharhiniform species alone was more robust than for
                 all sharks. In the carcharhiniform analysis, the
                 relationship between habitat type and trypanorhynch
                 assemblage was most remarkable. Overlapping host
                 ecology was evident even in phylogenetically-distant

                 Urochloa mutica (Forssk.) are pervasive throughout the
                 tropics, but the impacts on estuarine habitats and
                 biota are poorly understood. After weed control was
                 reduced in a tropical estuary, U. mutica reinvaded this
                 area composed of two contiguous habitats: a shallow
                 pond and a deeper river. These habitats are especially
                 important for \bioname{Mugil cephalus}, a culturally
                 prized native mullet, and introduced Moolgarda engeli
                 not targeted in the fishery. We investigated the
                 potential impacts of U. mutica on juvenile and adult
                 mullets by comparing the catch per unit effort (CPUE)
                 of the two mullet species and the physiochemical
                 measurements from the two contiguous habitats during
                 different stages of its reinvasion. Overall, negative
                 effects on the CPUE of M. cephalus and M. engeli were
                 found as a result of the U. mutica reinvasion. The M.
                 cephalus CPUE was consistently higher in the shallow
                 pond habitat compared to the deeper river habitat. It
                 decreased after U. mutica was established, correlative
                 to the invasive grass canopies smothering the shallow
                 habitat favored by juveniles. The M. engeli CPUE
                 significantly declined during the initial periods of U.
                 mutica reinvasion, but did not decline further after
                 the grass became established. No differences in the M.
                 engeli CPUE between habitats were found, indicating
                 that M. engeli are habitat generalists. These findings
                 are among the first in an insular tropical estuary
                 demonstrating a negative relationship between an
                 invasive grass and relative abundances of two
                 confamiliar fish, while revealing distinct patterns
                 attributed to species-specific traits. Importantly, the
                 broad overlapping biogeographic distribution of M.
                 cephalus and U. mutica, and the negative relationship
                 between these species, raises widespread concern for

                 native fishes and may compete with prized sportfish
                 juveniles in estuarine nursery habitat. Long-term
                 monitoring revealed that B. belizanus occurs in
                 estuarine waterbodies along a 31-km stretch of the

                 restored tidal habitat within the current range
                 probably will be invaded quite quickly by B.

                 recognized as one of the most promising fish species
                 for aquaculture diversification in the Persian Gulf and
                 the Oman Sea regions. In this regard, S. hasta has
                 received considerable attention, and nutritional
                 studies focused on establishing the nutritional
                 requirements for improving diet formulation have been
                 conducted during recent years. Considering the results
                 from different dose--response nutritional studies on
                 macronutrient requirements conducted in this species,
                 it can be concluded that diets containing ca. 48\%
                 crude protein, 15\% crude lipid, 15\% carbohydrates and
                 20 KJ g \minus 1 gross energy are recommended for
                 on-growing S. hasta juveniles. In addition, the optimum
                 essential amino acid profile for this species
                 (expressed as g 16 g N \minus 1), should be
                 approximately arginine 5.3, lysine 6.0, threonine 5.2,
                 histidine 2.5, isoleucine 4.6, leucine 5.4, methionine
                 + cysteine 4.0 (in a diet containing 0.6 cysteine),
                 phenylalanine + tyrosine 5.6 (in a diet containing 1.9
                 tyrosine), tryptophan 1.0 and valine 4.6. Moreover, the
                 optimum dietary n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty
                 acids and soybean lecithin are recommended to be 0.8\%
                 and 6\%, respectively. The maximum replacement of fish
                 meal with soy protein is recommended to be between
                 16.5\% and 27.3\%. In addition, different vegetal oil
                 sources are also recommended for partial and almost
                 complete replacement of fish oil in diets. Although the
                 nutritional requirements in terms of macronutrients
                 have been established under laboratory conditions, the
                 analysis of the available literature indicate that

                 characteristics such as high concentrations of carbon.
                 The oxygen can be considered a key factor since

                 water oxygen (from 6 \pm 1 to 13 \pm 1 mg/L) on
                 lymphocytes density in sea bass by using flow cytometry

                 aberrant codfishes with several extinct and currently
                 only one recognized extant species. The oldest
                 representatives of a Gadiculus lineage known from
                 otoliths are Early Miocene in age. Fossil evidence has
                 showed Gadiculus to originate from older genera
                 diverging early from other true cods of the family
                 Gadidae. As adult specimens of different species have
                 been found to be highly similar and difficult to
                 distinguish based on meristic and morphometric data,
                 the number of species in this gadid genus has been
                 controversial since different larval morphotypes were
                 first discovered some 100 years ago. For almost 70
                 years, Gadiculus thori and Gadiculus argenteus have
                 been considered subspecies only, with a distribution in
                 the Northeast Atlantic Ocean including the
                 Mediterranean. In this study, we resolve the
                 long-standing issue of extant Gadiculus not being
                 monotypic. New results in the form of distinct adult
                 otoliths and molecular data unambiguously show two
                 species of Gadiculus present --- in agreement with
                 larval morphotypes. Morphometric, meristic and
                 molecular characters, as well as larval pigmentation
                 are discussed in addition to present and past
                 geographic distributions of the two taxa from
                 distributions of fossil otoliths. At present, the
                 cold-water species Gadiculus thori (northern silvery
                 pout) is distributed in cold-temperate and subarctic
                 latitudes in the Northeast Atlantic, including a new
                 range extension off Southeast Greenland. Gadiculus
                 argenteus (southern silvery pout) occurs in warmer
                 waters and is distributed in the warm-temperate East
                 Atlantic and Mediterranean. Fossil otoliths show that

                 mystery circle had radially aligned peaks and valleys
                 with a central flat area, while the radius and the
                 differences in elevation between the peaks and valleys
                 were increasing. These features, which were observed
                 from days 5 to 8, were considered the middle stage of
                 construction. On day 9, the mystery circle was
                 completed. An irregular pattern was formed in the
                 central area, and the radially aligned peaks were
                 decorated with shell and coral fragments. These are the
                 first recorded observations of construction of a
                 mystery circle from the earliest stage.",

  abstract =     "Little is known about the concerted influence of
                 temperature and salinity on the fecundity of clupeid
                 fishes. Due to a globally changing climate, both
                 physical parameters might act as stressors, severely
                 affecting the reproductive potential of clupeid fish
                 populations inhabiting tropical estuaries. Differences
                 in relative batch fecundities, the gonado-somatic
                 index, and the condition index of bonga shad
                 (\bioname{Ethmalosa fimbriata}) were analysed in
                 individual females sampled at the Senegalese coast and
                 inside the inverse Sine Saloum estuary, where salinity
                 increases upstream in all seasons. Multiple linear
                 regression models on fecundity and gonadal energy
                 storage show that clupeids can adapt towards increasing
                 their reproductive investment at temperatures (26--30
                 \degree C) and salinities (42--51), which by far exceed
                 marine conditions, in an effort to maximize recruitment
                 success. This reproductive strategy, however, is
                 accompanied by a trade-off between reproductive effort
                 and somatic growth, which ultimately limits the
                 species' reproductive potential inside the estuary. The
                 observed high variability in batch fecundities might be
                 a viable mechanism to adjust to fluctuating and rather
                 extreme environmental conditions. Understanding the
                 spawning biology of exploited clupeid fishes in
                 drastically changing environments is crucial for
                 evaluating the reproductive potential of stocks at the
                 outer reach of their physiological performance curve.",

                 the fish's freshness. To investigate this, live red sea
                 breams were purchased, slaughtered, and prior to
                 measurement, stored at 22 \pm 2 \degree C for 27 h.
                 During subsequent storage, the K value of the dorsal
                 meat --- as a standard freshness indicator --- along
                 with front-face fluorescence spectra of representative
                 dorsal scales, were measured simultaneously at 3 h
                 intervals. Two major fluorescent peaks, A and B, were
                 identified with excitation and emission wavelength
                 pairs of 280/310 nm and 340/420 nm, which were mainly
                 contributed to by tyrosine and collagen, respectively.
                 Subsequent analysis showed that the fluorescence
                 intensity ratio of peak B to A (I B / I A) increased
                 linearly during storage (R 2 = 0.95) and is proposed as
                 a potential non-destructive index of fish freshness.
                 Thus, our results suggest that the fluorescence
                 characteristics of fish scales can be used to assess

                 photocells, allowing the monitoring of locomotor
                 activity continuously from August to February. Results
                 showed a preference of cuttlefish for being active
                 during the night in summer (24.2 \pm 1.3 \degree C) and
                 in autumn (18.4 \pm 3.4 \degree C), with maximum
                 activity peaks observed, respectively, at 01:09 h and

                 currently hindering the control over the lifecycle of
                 common octopus (\bioname{Octopus vulgaris} Cuvier,
                 1797). It is believed that this problem might be
                 related to either zoo-technical and/or nutritional
                 aspects. The present paper is focused on the study of
                 different zoo-technical aspects related to light
                 conditions on the rearing of paralarvae, including the
                 effects of polarization in prey ingestion, the use of a
                 blue filter to simulate natural conditions, and the use
                 of focused light to avoid reflections of the rearing
                 tank's walls. In the first experiment, O. vulgaris
                 paralarvae ingestion of Artemia sp. and copepods (Tisbe
                 sp.) was assessed under either normal or polarized
                 light. In the second experiment, the effect of a blue
                 filter with natural light or focused artificial light
                 on growth and mortality was assessed over 15 days of
                 rearing. Ingestion rate was not influenced by light
                 polarization. Nonetheless, a significantly higher
                 ingestion of Artemia sp. with respect to copepods was
                 observed. The blue filter promoted the use of natural
                 light conditions in Octopus paralarval culture, while
                 focused light reduced the collision of the paralarvae
                 against the walls. However, no significant differences

                 the goal of establishing this genetically-tractable
                 model system for further AMP studies. By mining
                 available genomic databases, zebrafish AMP sequences
                 homologous to AMPs from other vertebrates were selected
                 for further study. These included parasin I and its
                 enzyme cathepsin D, \beta -defensin (DB1),
                 liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2),
                 bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), and
                 chromogranin-A and -B (CgA and CgB). Specific primers
                 were designed for RT-PCR amplification of each AMP gene
                 of interest and amplicons between 242 bp and 504 bp
                 were obtained from RNA extracted from adult zebrafish.
                 Sequencing of the amplicons and alignment of their
                 deduced amino acid sequences with those from AMPs from
                 other vertebrate species confirmed their identity. The
                 temporal expression of AMPs was investigated by RT-PCR
                 analysis in fertilized oocytes, embryos, and adult
                 individuals. Parasin I and chatepsin D transcripts were
                 detectable immediately after fertilization, while the
                 transcripts for CgA and CgB became evident starting at
                 48 h post fertilization. Mature transcripts of LEAP2
                 and DB1 were detectable only in the adult zebrafish,
                 while BPI transcripts were detectable starting from the
                 12th day post fertilization. To explore the possible
                 upregulation of AMP expression by infectious challenge,
                 experiments were carried out in adult zebrafish by
                 intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of
                 lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. Except for
                 CgA and CgB, amplicons corresponding to all tested AMPs
                 showed stronger signals in the experimental animals as
                 compared to the unchallenged controls. This study
                 provided information on the early expression of AMPs in
                 zebrafish from ontogeny to adulthood and their
                 inducibility by microbials. This information could be
                 useful to actuate new prophylactic strategies as an
                 alternative to the use of antibiotics in culture.",

  abstract =     "The management of highly migratory species (HMS) is a
                 complex domestic and international system that was
                 initially established to regulate HMS taken in
                 commercial fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. For
                 managing HMS taken in recreational fisheries, the
                 authority and the data required is lacking and remains
                 to be stipulated by regulating bodies. In the {United
                 States}, Florida saltwater anglers target various HMS,
                 but swordfish (\bioname{Xiphias gladius}) is a favorite
                 among anglers. The recreational swordfish fishery off
                 the Southeast Florida coast has experienced resurgence
                 in recent years, with directed tournaments resuming in
                 2001 after being absent almost 20 years. Today, South
                 Florida supports the largest group of recreational
                 swordfish anglers in the world. Despite the increasing
                 popularity and interest, little data is available
                 describing the recreational swordfish fishery and its
                 socio-economic aspects in South Florida. This study
                 aimed to compile, describe, and identify the
                 demographics, fishing tactics, costs, and fishery
                 management perceptions of recreational swordfish
                 anglers in South Florida based on nonprobability
                 purposive sampling organized through the Southeast
                 Swordfish Club (SESC). The sample size (n = 38)
                 represented about 16--38\% of the SESC members and
                 between 6\% and 8\% of the recreational anglers that
                 actively targeted swordfish in South Florida during the
                 time of the survey. We acknowledge the sample size was
                 small (n = 38), but believe the study encompassed the
                 most active swordfish anglers given their knowledge,
                 expertise, and connection with the fishery in terms of
                 participants, fishing effort, and fishing techniques.
                 As such, it is highly probable that a large portion of
                 the recreational swordfish angling population was
                 represented by members of the SESC in terms of
                 swordfishing gear, techniques, and socio-economics,
                 which reduced apparent bias in the study. Overall, the
                 annual income of recreational swordfish anglers in 2007
                 ranged from US \$15,000 to \$200,000 with an average
                 income of \$91,940 ($ n = 33$). Sixty-nine percent of
                 polled anglers indicated they had more than 26 years of
                 recreational fishing experience and 81\% had less than
                 10 years of experience targeting swordfish in South
                 Florida. Thirty-seven percent of surveyed anglers
                 indicated they departed from Port Everglades, Florida.
                 To target swordfish, anglers generally used five rods
                 and set their bait, commonly squid, at 91 m. Anglers
                 also indicated they changed their fishing tactics from
                 day to night, and took about five fishing trips per
                 month. Overall, anglers spent around \$14,210 on annual
                 costs associated with swordfishing, which was 16\% of
                 their annual income. Many polled anglers also reported
                 they were dissatisfied with the current swordfish
                 management regulations.",

                 sampling sites during winter season targeting the
                 collection of fish species. A total of 48 samples were
                 collected. Individuals from seven different taxa
                 (marine and estuarine) were collected, although the
                 assemblage was dominated by two estuarine species ---
                 the native Pomatoschistus sp. (goby) and the NIS
                 \bioname{Fundulus heteroclitus} (mummichog). Goby was
                 the most abundant taxa in the majority of salt marsh
                 habitats, except for one specific, marsh pool, where
                 extreme environmental conditions were registered,
                 namely high temperature and salinity. Such conditions
                 may have boosted the intrusion of mummichog in this
                 area. This species is well adapted to a wide range of
                 abiotic factors enabling them to colonize habitats
                 where no predators inhabit. Impacts of mummichog
                 introduction in the Guadiana salt marsh area are still
                 unpredictable since this is the first time they have
                 been recorded in such high density. Nevertheless, in
                 scenarios of increased anthropogenic pressure and,
                 consequently, habitat degradation, there is a potential
                 risk of mummichog spreading to other habitats and
                 therefore competing for space and food resources with
                 native species.",

                 usually lacking in some essential amino acids and fatty
                 acids. The microalgae \bioname{Chlorella vulgaris} has
                 good-quality protein with amino acids rich in
                 methionine, lysine and alanine. Four novel diets having
                 C. vulgaris as the main source of protein were produced
                 for African catfish \bioname{Clarias gariepinus} with
                 an initial average weight of 1.09 \pm 0.05 g. The diets
                 were labeled Feed 1 (F1) to feed 4 (F4). The treatment
                 diets were included 25\% (F1), 15\% (F2), 5\% (F3) and
                 0\% (F4) green algae meal. The basal ingredients of the
                 feed were corn (maize) included as F1, 40\%, F2, 43\%,
                 F3, 53\% and F4, 43\%; and millet meal, which varied in
                 F1 as 23\%, F2, 30\%, F3, 30\% and F4, 30\%. The
                 ingredients were preconditioned at 110 \degree C and
                 pelleted. Post-fingerling African catfish were stocked
                 at 10 fish per aquarium. There were three replicate
                 aquariums for each feed type and the fish were fed for
                 60 d. The specific growth rate was best for the catfish
                 fed with 25\% C. vulgaris diet 7.86 \pm 0\% day \minus
                 1, and worst at 6.77 \pm 0.07\% day \minus 1 for the
                 control group F4, 0\% algal meal. The food conversion
                 ratio (FCR) was lowest (1.88 \pm 0.02) for 25\% algal
                 meal diet (F1) and highest (2.98 \pm 0.01) for the 0\%
                 algal meal diet F4. Similarly, catfish had average
                 weight gain of 121.02 \pm 0.04 g for those fed with F1
                 compared to 62.50 \pm 0.0 g for those fed with 0\%
                 algae F4. Protein efficiency ratio was highest for the
                 F1-fed fish (2.46 \pm 0.22) and lowest for those fed
                 with F4 (2.02 \pm 0.09). The hepatosomatic index was
                 lowest for F1-fed fish (1.48 \pm 0.01) and highest for
                 catfish fed with F4 (2.50 \pm 0.59). Based on the
                 results, C. vulgaris is a good protein source for

                 Barbonymus gonionotus. Post fingerlings of B.
                 gonionotus were reared in five treatments, labeled T 1
                 to T 5, by substituting 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and
                 100\% protein of CFF with A. pinnata protein (dry
                 matter basis) respectively for 56 days. The specific
                 growth rate, net production rate, protein efficiency
                 ratio, proximate composition, and overall conditions of
                 fish were not significantly varied between the fish
                 reared completely with CFF and 25\% substitution with
                 A. pinnata. However, a significantly higher profit rate
                 (431.49 USD ha \minus 1 56 day \minus 1) was calculated
                 for fish reared in T 2 than other treatments. In
                 contrast, there was a significant reduction of growth
                 and other parameters of the fish that were observed in
                 the case where more than 25\% CFF was substituted with
                 A. pinnata. The poorest performance was observed in
                 fish fed completely with A. pinnata, at T 5. Based on
                 the results, 25\% of CFF of Thai silver barb could be
                 substituted with fresh A. pinnata without significantly
                 lowering their growth and product quality and could
                 contribute significant to a higher profit margin.",

                 environmental hazard assessment, as well as for
                 biomonitoring applications. Larval stages of the sand
                 goby (\bioname{Pomatoschistus minutus}) possess a
                 number of attractive qualities for experimental testing
                 that make it a promising species in behavioural
                 ecotoxicology. Here, we present a study aimed at
                 developing a toolkit for using the sand goby as novel
                 species for ecotoxicological studies and using
                 locomotion as an alternative endpoint in toxicity
                 testing. Exposure to three contaminants (copper (Cu),
                 di-butyl phthalate (DBP) and perfluorooctanoic acid
                 (PFOA)) was tested in the early life stages of the sand
                 goby and the locomotion patterns of the larvae were
                 quantified using an automatic tracking system. In a
                 photo-motor test, sand goby larvae displayed
                 substantially higher activity in light than in dark
                 cycles. Furthermore, all tested compounds exerted
                 behavioural alterations, such as hypo- and
                 hyperactivity. Our experimental results show that sand
                 goby larvae produce robust and quantifiable locomotive
                 responses, which could be used within an
                 ecotoxicological context for assessing the behavioural
                 toxicity of environmental pollutants, with particular
                 relevance in the Nordic region. This study thus
                 suggests that sand goby larvae have potential as an
                 environmentally relevant species for behavioural
                 ecotoxicology, and as such offer an alternative to
                 standard model species.",

  abstract =     "Blooms of the planktonic alga \bioname{Prymnesium
                 parvum} pose a global threat, causing fish kills
                 worldwide. Early studies on the exposure of fish to P.
                 parvum indicate that toxic effects are related to gill
                 damage. The more strictly defined concept of adverse
                 outcome pathways has been suggested as a replacement
                 for the mode of action in toxicology studies. In this
                 study, rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) were exposed
                 to P. parvum. During exposure, oxygen consumption was
                 determined by respirometry, and ventilation and
                 coughing rate were determined via video surveillance.
                 Per breath oxygen consumption was calculated to assess
                 the ventilation effort to obtain a unit of oxygen. A
                 second experiment monitored fish behavior to assess
                 recovery. The results indicated that oxygen consumption
                 initially increased, but on average fell below the
                 standard oxygen consumption at 70\% relative exposure.
                 Being a function of ventilation frequency and oxygen
                 consumption, the per breath oxygen consumption
                 decreased throughout exposure. Behavioral results
                 determined that short-term P. parvum exposure
                 subsequently caused the exposed fish to seek flow
                 refuge immediately and to a greater extent than
                 unexposed fish. The adverse outcome pathway of P.
                 parvum on rainbow trout is that P. parvum acts as a
                 gill irritant resulting in non-recoverable respiratory
                 failure.",

                 not clearly understood. That is the case with scales,
                 which have always been attributed a mere protective
                 role, but which are proving to have more functions than
                 it was traditionally thought. To acquire a deeper
                 knowledge, scales from six different regions of
                 gilthead seabream (\bioname{Sparus aurata} {L.}) were
                 studied and measured by image analysis. Results prove
                 that scales from the base of the dorsal fin are larger
                 than those in other parts of the fish body while scales
                 from the peduncle are the smallest of the skin.
                 Furthermore, a technique relatively new in this field,
                 known as atomic force microscopy (AFM), was used to
                 obtain representations of the ultrastructure of the
                 scales and measure certain features such as the circuli
                 and the lines in the basal layer. The data obtained
                 allowed us to compare the height of circuli among the
                 different scales, showing that they were higher in
                 scales from the dorsum and the operculum. The present
                 results introduce a nanostructural model of the scales
                 of gilthead seabream that might serve as a useful
                 guideline for future studies.",

                 important to minimize such effects and one option is
                 the use of dietary additives. In the present
                 experiment, meagre (\bioname{Argyrosomus regius})
                 specimens were fed three different diets: a control

                 tryptophan-supplemented diet and an
                 aspartate-supplemented diet. For each diet, fish were

                 increasingly recognize the importance of mycotoxins,
                 which contaminate plant-based meals used in compound
                 aquafeeds, and their potential to negatively impact
                 production. Though data on the worldwide occurrence of
                 legislated mycotoxins e.g., trichothecenes and
                 zearalenone (ZEN) are well documented, relatively
                 little information is available regarding other
                 mycotoxins also produced by Fusarium, notably
                 moniliformin (MON). Given that MON is known to affect
                 the survival, growth, skeletal formation and bone
                 mineralization in terrestrial species, its widespread
                 occurrence on maize and maize by-products typically
                 used in aquaculture makes it relevant to study these
                 parameters in teleost fish. In the present work we have
                 tested the effect of MON exposure on survival, bone
                 development and mineralization using zebrafish
                 (\bioname{Danio rerio}) as a model species and fish
                 derived osteo-chondroprogenitor cell line for in vitro
                 studies. Moniliformin exposure did not decrease bone
                 mineralization in zebrafish larvae or extracellular
                 matrix mineralization in the mineralogenic cell line
                 VSa13. Here, the minimal in vitro cytotoxicity
                 concentration was found to be 1000 $ \mu $ g L \minus 1
                 MON. Incidence of deformities was also not altered by
                 MON at the concentration tested (450 $ \mu $ g L \minus
                 1) although larval growth was affected, as shown by a
                 decrease in the standard length of exposed specimens at
                 20 days post fertilization. Survival decreased
                 significantly in larvae exposed to MON concentrations
                 higher than 900 \mu g L \minus 1. Influence of MON on
                 survival and growth might be relevant for aquaculture
                 industry. As MON is a water-soluble mycotoxin, its
                 leaching from feed is highly probable, so MON
                 assimilation into the surrounding aqueous environment
                 should also be considered. Tested levels in fish larvae
                 are within the reported occurrence levels of MON in
                 commercial feed and plant meals.",

                 prepared from dry-cured tuna loins in southern Portugal
                 and Spain. The production procedure has seen little
                 change over the last centuries. The muxama's stability
                 is due to reduced water activity. In addition, the
                 drying method has secondary effects on characteristics
                 of flavor, color, and the nutritional value of the
                 product. Our objectives were to describe the dynamics
                 of important physicochemical parameters such as
                 moisture content, water activity (a W), NaCl
                 concentration (as water--phase salt, Z NaCl), pH and
                 color, during the salting and drying stages of muxama
                 production, and to test the effect(s) of changes in the
                 traditional processing conditions followed in southern
                 Portugal, aiming at optimizing the production
                 procedure. The lowest values of moisture and a W and
                 highest Z NaCl obtained after drying tuna loins for
                 seven days at 20 \degree C exceeded the values reported
                 for commercial products and have impact on the
                 appearance (color) of the product. Therefore, drying
                 tuna loins at lower temperatures (ca. 14 \degree C) is
                 probably more appropriate. The results obtained in this
                 study could be used in the design of future experiments
                 at other conditions and to assess other quality
                 parameters, e.g., total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N),
                 thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBA-RS),
                 microorganism abundance and sensory attributes, and

                 each individual. The daily catch limit is intended to
                 represent the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) for
                 casulo beyond which overfishing will occur. The
                 monitoring of the regulatory measures is expected to be
                 conducted through on-site inspections in the digging
                 areas. However, weak law enforcement was noticed, while
                 there is also controversy over the daily catch limit
                 (quota) stipulated by the Ordinance. To this end, the
                 current study attempted to assess digging activities
                 through remote monitoring and random inspections for a
                 better policy enforcement of the national regulation.
                 In addition, different harvesting scenarios were
                 employed through a simplified bioeconomic model to
                 attribute the current and future harvesting trends of
                 bait digging in Aveiro coastal lagoon. The study
                 findings indicate that remote monitoring coupled with
                 some onsite interviews could be a more effective
                 approach for the implementation of the current bait
                 digging policy. Further, the results point to a
                 distinctive discrepancy between the daily catch amount
                 (MSY) introduced by the national legislation and the
                 study findings which should be further scrutinized. The
                 diggers seem to have reached the sustainable harvest
                 identified by the present research. The current
                 economic hardship in Portugal and the low profitability
                 in similar employment sectors will possibly attract
                 more diggers and increase harvesting in the near
                 future. An increased harvest would likely trigger
                 overfishing of D. neapolitana with unknown consequences
                 for the population of the species as well as the
                 aquatic ecosystem. The socio-economic and environmental
                 effects are yet to be further clarified with more
                 detailed data and advanced modeling techniques to
                 ensure the sustainability of the activity.",

                 systems has long been recognized in vertebrates. In
                 fish, it is known that the prevalence and intensity of
                 such infections are higher in males than in females and
                 probably related to sex steroid hormone levels. In
                 addition, the immune response in the fish gonad tissues
                 is specifically regulated to prevent infertility. This
                 condition is used by some pathogens to colonize the
                 fish gonad, evade the systemic immune response, and so
                 spread to the progeny. This review brings up to date
                 our knowledge concerning fish gonad immunity and its
                 regulation, immune-endocrine interactions, and how some

                 species to NNV infections, and this virus has been
                 associated to vertical transmission since it is
                 detected in gonad fluids as well as in testicular
                 gametes. In fact, sea bass immunity in the gonad is
                 regulated in a very different way to other target
                 tissues (brain and retina) or immune-relevant tissues

                 main objectives of the present study were to identify
                 the breeding season of Pool barb through observation of
                 the gonadosomatic index (GSI), fecundity, oocytes
                 diameter, and gonadal histology of the species. GSI was
                 calculated and fecundity was determined by the
                 gravimetric method. Interestingly, the highest value of
                 GSI was 15.43 \pm 2.20 for the month of April at
                 Gazipur while it was 15.60 \pm 1.74 in June for
                 Jessore. In Gazipur, the highest fecundity (5053 \pm

                 highest fecundity (5433 \pm 968.26) was recorded in the

                 perinucleolar stage of oocytes during March indicating
                 immature oocyte. Histological data revealed that the

                 farmed salmon (\bioname{Salmo salar}) for the targeted

                 mucus was either scraped off, wiped off using medical

                 analysis of the mucus samples from equally treated

                 small-molecule metabolomics of skin mucus in fish would
                 benefit from a sampling regime employing absorption of
                 the water phase in order to minimize the bias related
                 to the sampling step. Furthermore, the absorption
                 method is also a less invasive approach allowing for
                 repetitive sampling within short time intervals.",

                 (1990--1994 and 2008--2011) were compared to identify
                 species with substantial variation in their relative
                 abundance between the two periods. The aim of this
                 study was to examine if certain ecological traits
                 characterize fish species showing an increase or
                 decrease in relative abundance, and if non-indigenous
                 fishes with strongly increasing populations may have
                 caused the decline of native species with similar
                 habitats and diets. We found that the main predictors
                 of population trends were species length, habitat
                 affinity, and maximum depth, with larger and soft
                 bottom species displaying decreasing abundances.
                 Comparing native and non-indigenous fishes with similar
                 habitat and diet, we found a potential for competitive
                 impact of the Indo-Pacific \bioname{Plotosus lineatus}
                 and two Upeneus spp. on the native Mullus species.
                 However, competition with non-indigenous fishes could
                 not generally explain the dramatic decline of many
                 other native species between the two study periods.
                 Alternative causes, such as fishery pressure and
                 increasing water temperature, are discussed.",

                 selection programs using hatchery-produced breeding
                 stocks. The greater amberjack \bioname{Seriola
                 dumerili} is a cosmopolitan pelagic species that has
                 been considered as a good candidate for the species
                 diversification of aquaculture production in the
                 Mediterranean region. However, commercial production is
                 still very limited due to bottlenecks in reproduction,
                 larval rearing and management control during grow out.
                 The aim of the present study was to examine the
                 reproductive development of hatchery-produced greater
                 amberjack and to develop a spawning induction protocol
                 based on the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone
                 agonist (GnRHa) in a controlled-release delivery
                 system. The results showed that hatchery-produced
                 greater amberjack undergo normal gametogenesis and can
                 be induced to undergo maturation, ovulation and
                 spawning after multiple administrations of GnRHa
                 implants, over an extended spawning period lasting from
                 May to September in the Canary Islands, Spain. The use
                 of GnRHa-delivery systems resulted in multiple spawns
                 of fertilized and viable eggs. Egg production was high
                 and egg quality adequate for the implementation of
                 larval rearing for commercial purposes. The handling
                 required to administer the GnRHa implants during the
                 prolonged spawning season did not result in any
                 negative effect on the welfare and reproductive
                 performance of the fish based on evaluation of several
                 biochemical parameters. The developed reproduction
                 control method shows great potential to advance the
                 commercial production of greater amberjack, by enabling

                 Improving the quality of their meat will produce
                 fillets that may have a higher economic value in the
                 market, and thus be beneficial for the management of
                 this fishery. In other animal species destined for
                 human consumption, a negative relationship between
                 pre-slaughtering stress and meat quality has been
                 demonstrated. By studying the commercial small-spotted
                 catshark (\bioname{Scyliorhinus canicula}), this work
                 aimed at linking pre-slaughter handling of captured
                 sharks and muscle fillets quality. An experimental
                 group of adult and subadult living catsharks captured
                 by hand and exposed to air (for 18 min, which is the
                 minimum time this species is exposed to air in the
                 fishing deck during fisheries procedures), and an
                 undisturbed group, were evaluated. After air exposure,
                 catsharks returned to water for recovery. Muscle
                 lactate and water content were quantified after acute
                 exposure (for 18 min), 5 h and 24 h. This challenge
                 elicited stress responses in the muscle such as
                 increased lactate levels and immediate dehydration,
                 followed by recovery of lactate levels and
                 overhydration. Muscle consistency, a relevant variable
                 describing quality of seafood according to its ability
                 to be swallowed by the consumer, paralleled muscle
                 water content changes. The results indicated for the
                 first time that handling alive sharks exposed to air
                 results in muscle fillets with different texture
                 properties. Whether these changes in muscle texture
                 induce higher quality fillets has yet to be proven. Our
                 recommendation is to minimize time of air exposure
                 experienced by sharks when captured, including fast
                 slaughtering instead of leaving them to die by
                 asphyxia, as current on-board procedures.",

                 Annular age estimates were improved with measurements

                 years. We also evaluated the addition of otolith edge

                 is the most common shark landed in Indonesian waters,
                 including in the Indian Ocean. However, even though
                 they are frequently caught, there is a lack of
                 information on the population and abundance of silky
                 sharks in the Indian Ocean. Cilacap and Tanjung Luar
                 are two of Indonesia's shark fishery hotspots, both
                 located on the edge of the Indian Ocean, which is a
                 part of the Indonesian Fisheries Management Area (FMA)
                 573. The fishers from both places usually have fishing

                 This research aims to update the abundance, and to

                 popular in some European countries such as Poland,
                 France and Ireland. These systems generally operate in
                 flow-through configuration. The impact such production
                 systems might have on water quality remains mostly
                 unknown. The present study was set up to fulfil this
                 objective of monitoring water quality on different fish
                 farm locations in order to identify the impacts of the
                 whole farm (comparison of farm inlet and outlet) and at

                 dynamics and to better understand the impact of
                 multiple water reuse (water passes) in a given pond on
                 water quality. In the absence of any sort of water
                 treatment, an increase in the number of water passes
                 was shown to create an increase in ammonium
                 concentration along the farm. Finally, this traditional
                 flow-through rainbow trout production system was
                 revealed to almost be at its full carrying capacity
                 with respect to internal water quality parameters and
                 fish welfare. To increase fish production, some water
                 treatment techniques (solid/liquid separation,
                 nitrification) would have to be introduced in order to
                 optimize the rearing water quality for fish growth and
                 to minimize the release of pollutants in the receiving
                 water to limit the impact on the environment.",

                 \bioname{Scomber japonicus} (chub mackerel) and
                 \bioname{Scomber australasicus} (blue mackerel).
                 Because S. japonicus has a much higher market price
                 than S. australasicus, the two species must be properly
                 sorted before shipment, but their similar appearance
                 makes discrimination difficult. These species can be
                 effectively distinguished using the ratio of the base
                 length between the dorsal fin's first and ninth spines
                 to the fork length. However, manual measurement of this
                 ratio is time-consuming and reduces fish freshness. The
                 proposed technique instead uses image processing to
                 measure these lengths. We were able to successfully
                 discriminate between the two species using the ratio as
                 a geometric feature, in combination with several
                 texture features. We then quantitatively verified the
                 effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrated

                 combinations thereof. Treatment with the individual
                 stressors evoked the expected responses in the
                 respective physiological target systems --- body
                 growth, immune system, and hepatic vitellogenin
                 transcription --- but we found little evidence for
                 significant negative relations (trade-offs) between the
                 three systems. This also applied to fish exposed to
                 combinations of the stressors. This high phenotypic
                 flexibility of trout in their resource allocation
                 suggests that linear resource allocations as mechanisms
                 of phenotypic plasticity may be too simplistic, but it
                 also may point to a greater capacity of ectothermic
                 than endothermic vertebrates to maintain key
                 physiological processes under competing resource needs
                 due to lower maintenance costs.",

                 fish farming. The meagre (\bioname{Argyrosomus regius})
                 arose as a promising species due to its fast growth
                 rates and flesh quality. Thus, it is currently being
                 produced in several Mediterranean countries, mainly in
                 sea-cages and salt-marshes. However, although meagre

                 waters, to date it is cultured in seawater. Here, we
                 show that juveniles may not successfully face either
                 freshwater or hyper-osmotic environments as high as 55
                 ppt salinity. We found that 55 ppt induced catabolism
                 and mobilization of energy metabolites stored in the
                 liver, probably to maintain its osmotic balance.
                 Furthermore, we found that osmoregulatory tissues such
                 as gills managed to maintain plasma osmolality levels
                 without differences in meagre acclimated at 5, 12 and
                 39 ppt salinity. Our results demonstrate the euryhaline
                 capacity of this species, highlighting that juveniles
                 may be cultured in a wider range of salinities rather
                 than just at seawater. Future studies should focus on

  abstract =     "Egg quality in fishes has been a topic of research in
                 aquaculture and fisheries for decades as it represents
                 an important life history trait and is critical for
                 captive propagation and successful recruitment. A major
                 factor influencing egg quality is proper yolk
                 formation, as most fishes are oviparous and the
                 developing offspring are entirely dependent on stored
                 egg yolk for nutritional sustenance. These maternally
                 derived nutrients consist of proteins, carbohydrates,
                 lipids, vitamins, minerals, and ions that are
                 transported from the liver to the ovary by lipoprotein
                 particles including vitellogenins. The yolk composition
                 may be influenced by broodstock diet, husbandry, and
                 other intrinsic and extrinsic conditions. In addition,
                 a number of other maternal factors that may influence
                 egg quality also are stored in eggs, such as gene
                 transcripts, that direct early embryonic development.
                 Dysfunctional regulation of gene or protein expression
                 may lead to poor quality eggs and failure to thrive
                 within hours of fertilization. These gene transcripts
                 may provide important markers as their expression
                 levels may be used to screen broodstock for potential
                 spawning success. In addition to such intrinsic
                 factors, stress may lead to ovarian atresia or
                 reproductive failure and can impact fish behavior,
                 fecundity, and ovulation rate. Finally, postovulatory
                 aging may occur when eggs become overripe and the fish
                 fails to spawn in a timely fashion, leading to low
                 fertility, often encountered during manual strip
                 spawning of fish.",

                 December 2016 to April 2017. A control sample was also
                 prepared in the laboratory with the same raw fish used
                 by the producers to compare the results. Gas
                 chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD)
                 was used to detect and quantify OCP residues. Six
                 samples out of 27 (about 22\%) were found to be

                 5.2 {\pm} 0.04 log cfu g {-1} for control samples.
                 Fungal count ranged from 3.2 {\pm} 0.04 log cfu g {-1}
                 to 3.5 {\pm} 0.04 log cfu g {-1}, 3.4 {\pm} 0.04 log

                 {-1} for producer, retailer, and control samples,
                 respectively. All the producer and retailer samples and
                 one-third of the control samples were found to be
                 contaminated with \bioname{Escherichia coli}, whereas

                 females completed oogenesis, underwent oocyte
                 maturation, and spawned spontaneously under both
                 constant and fluctuating temperatures. The sex steroid
                 hormones of both males and females followed the
                 already-known profiles during fish gametogenesis,
                 except for 17,20{\beta}-dihydroxy-progesterone, which
                 did not seem to be related to either female or male
                 maturation. The female reproductive dysfunctions that
                 were identified included (a) the arrest of oogenesis at
                 the cortical alveoli stage in certain females; (b) the
                 failure to undergo oocyte maturation in others; and (c)
                 the production of large percentages of unfertilized
                 eggs from the females that spawned spontaneously. Our
                 study suggests that reproduction in captivity is
                 possible in wreckfish maintained under typical marine
                 aquaculture conditions, but that reliable spawning and
                 production of high-quality eggs may require some years
                 of adaptation to captivity, before the reproductive
                 dysfunctions will be overcome.",

                 and poses a constraint for the development of farming
                 of new species. In 2017, Siberian sturgeon
                 (\bioname{Acipenser baerii}) juveniles were imported
                 from Italy to a Swedish farm. Transport conditions were
                 suboptimal. Thirty percent died during transport and
                 within the first days after arrival. Ten days after
                 arrival, mortalities started to occur again, which
                 prompted initiation of an investigation into the
                 mortalities. Diseased fish were transported live to the
                 National Veterinary Institute (SVA) for necropsy and
                 further analysis. Pathological and histopathological
                 investigation was conducted. Virology was performed on
                 gills and internal organs by cell culture isolation and
                 using specific PCR protocols against nervous necrosis
                 virus (NNV) and Acipenser iridovirus European (AcIV-E).
                 The juveniles displayed neurological signs such as
                 lethargy, inability to maintain an upright position,
                 and erratic swimming. Body condition was below normal,
                 and gills were pale. One fish had petechial hemorrhages
                 on the abdomen and the snout. Two specimens had
                 intestinal hyperemia. Ventricles were air-filled, and
                 swim bladders were deflated. Viral cell cultures gave
                 negative results, but PCR analysis of gills and
                 internal organs detected the presence of AcIV-E. We
                 conclude that AcIV-E was associated with disease and
                 high mortality in the sturgeon juveniles, and stress
                 probably aggravated the course of the infection.",

                 purposes, little is known about its efficiency. Here,
                 we assessed the viability of reintroduction of the
                 endangered migratory fish, Brycon orbignyanus, in an
                 area of the Upper Uruguay River basin where the species
                 has not been reported for more than 30 years. We
                 released 4000 yearling juveniles in the Pelotas River
                 in 2014 and maintained 400 juveniles in captivity as a
                 control population. After three years, a total of 13
                 individuals was recaptured, of which, 10 were
                 considered sexually mature with first maturation being
                 recorded in animals larger than 42 cm in total body
                 length. The age--length comparison with a control
                 population growth curve showed that recaptured fish
                 were slightly bigger than those in captivity.
                 Furthermore, important ecological attributes as
                 schooling behavior and dispersal capacity were recorded
                 for all recaptured individuals. Combined, our results
                 suggest that the re-establishment of a self-sustained
                 population of locally extinct species B. orbignyanus in
                 the Pelotas River may be successful if sustained over

  abstract =     "This study investigated whether compensatory growth
                 causes long-term effects in relative brain- or
                 intestine size in a wild, predominantly anadromous,
                 population of brown trout (\bioname{Salmo trutta}). The
                 subject fish belonged to two treatment groups; one
                 group had undergone starvation and subsequent growth
                 compensation, while the other were unrestricted
                 controls. The main hypothesis that compensatory growth
                 would negatively affect brain and intestinal size, as a
                 consequence of growth trade-offs during the
                 compensatory phase, could not be supported as no
                 significant differences were detected between the
                 treatment groups. Further exploratory analyses
                 suggested that males and females started to diverge in
                 both brain and intestine size at around 130 mm fork
                 length, with females developing relatively smaller
                 brains and larger intestines. The size at which the
                 differences appear is a typical size for smoltification
                 (saltwater preadaptation), and females tend to smoltify
                 to a higher proportion than males. Smoltification is
                 known to cause a more elongated morphology and
                 relatively smaller heads in salmonids, and the marine
                 lifestyle is associated with rapid growth, which could
                 require relatively larger intestines. Hence, these
                 emerging sex differences could be a consequence of
                 sex-biased smoltification rates. An investigation of
                 wild smolts of both sexes indicated no differences in
                 brain or intestine mass between male and female
                 smolts.",

                 Laboratory species could also benefit from enrichment,
                 but it is not always clear what constitutes an enriched
                 environment. The zebrafish, \bioname{Danio rerio}, is
                 used widely in research and is one of the most
                 commonly-used laboratory animals. We investigated
                 whether changing the structural complexity of housing
                 tanks altered the behaviour of one strain of zebrafish.
                 Fish were kept in three treatments: (1) very enhanced
                 (VE); (2) mildly enhanced (ME); and (3) control (CT).
                 Level of aggression, fertilisation success, and growth
                 were measured at regular intervals in a subset of fish
                 in each treatment group. The VE fish were more
                 aggressive over time than either ME or CT fish, both in
                 the number of attacks they made against a mirror image
                 and in their tendency to stay close to their reflection
                 rather than avoid it. Furthermore, VE fish were shorter
                 than CT fish by the end of the experiment, though mass
                 was not significantly affected. There was no
                 significant effect of treatment on fertilisation
                 success. These findings suggest that the way in which
                 fish are housed in the laboratory can significantly
                 affect their behaviour, and potentially, their growth.
                 The zebrafish is a shoaling species with a dominance
                 hierarchy, and so may become territorial over objects
                 placed in the tank. The enrichment of laboratory tanks
                 should consider aspects of the species' behaviour.",

  abstract =     "Cannibalism occurs in many cultured fish species,
                 especially at the larval and juvenile stages of
                 piscivorous taxa. In farmed percid species, such as
                 pikeperch (\bioname{Sander lucioperca}), intra-cohort
                 cannibalism is a major issue inducing significant
                 losses of the initial stocking density during the first
                 weeks of rearing. Therefore, the present study was
                 designed to investigate the effects of perch larvae
                 (\bioname{Perca fluviatilis}) as live prey on growth,
                 survival and cannibalism in pikeperch larvae under
                 experimental conditions. Additionally, zootechnical and
                 behavioural variables linked to aggressiveness (S
                 postures, attacks, bites and ingestion), and group
                 structures were considered. The survival rate was not
                 different between the two groups (72\% with prey vs.
                 69\% without prey), but the cannibalism rate was higher
                 in the group with the prey (28\% vs. 10\%). The means
                 of final weight and length of pikeperch larvae were
                 higher in the group fed with perch larvae, but size
                 heterogeneity measured by the coefficients of variation
                 for these two parameters did not differ. The specific
                 growth rate was higher in the group fed with perch
                 larvae, but there was no difference between the two
                 groups concerning Fulton's condition factor. Among all
                 the behavioural variables (aggressiveness, group
                 structure), none differed between the two groups.",

  abstract =     "Ionic homeostasis is an essential component of
                 functioning cells, and ionic stress imposed by
                 excessive salinity can disrupt cellular and
                 physiological processes. Therefore, increasing salinity
                 of aquatic environments---a consequence of global
                 climate change---has the potential to adversely affect
                 the health of aquatic animals and their ecosystems. The
                 ability to respond adaptively to adverse environmental
                 changes is essential for the survival of species, but
                 animals in early embryonic stages may be particularly
                 vulnerable, as they cannot easily escape from such
                 conditions. Herein, the effects of increasing salinity
                 on the mortality and hatching time of zebrafish
                 (\bioname{Danio rerio}) embryos were investigated.
                 Increasing salinity significantly affected mortality
                 after 24 h of exposure beginning from {$<$2} h
                 post-fertilisation, with 10 parts per thousand (ppt)
                 inducing complete lethality. The 24-h LC50 of NaCl to
                 embryos was estimated to be approximately 5.6 ppt.
                 Interestingly, 5 ppt, a test concentration only
                 slightly lower than the LC50, induced earlier hatching
                 than at lower concentrations. This earlier hatching was
                 also observed even when exposure was commenced at later
                 stages of embryogenesis, despite later-stage embryos
                 not suffering appreciable mortality in response to
                 salinity. The results suggest that earlier hatching is
                 a plastic response which may function to enable embryos
                 to evade unfavourable conditions.",

                 Superoxide anion production and phagocytosis were
                 decreased by low doses of CSE and increased with high
                 doses. CSE and GA differently regulated cytokine
                 expression in blood and intestinal leukocytes. High
                 doses of CSE upregulated IL-1{\beta}, TNF-{\alpha}, and

                 very little is known regarding the fate of hatchery

                 non-native rainbow trout, \bioname{Salvelinus

                 place on the Cherokee Qualla Boundary in North
                 Carolina, a location with one of the highest riverine
                 stocked trout densities in the eastern {United States}.
                 During May 2017, 10 waterproof cameras were deployed
                 for 1-hour intervals on each carcass twice daily for a

                 only 24.7\% visited by crayfish, with a maximum of 9
                 and a mean of 1.93 for N. micropogon. Half of the
                 carcasses were removed within 2 days. Based on natural

                 Until now, genomic or transcriptomic information for
                 any species within the genus Polyprion has either
                 remained unpublished or is non-existent. Using Illumina
                 HiSeq, we compared the transcriptomes of h{\=a}puku

                 developmental stage-specific variations underlying
                 their reproductive physiology. We sought to identify
                 differentially expressed genes and the associated
                 shifts in biological pathways between previtellogenic
                 and early vitellogenic ovaries. Ovarian tissue was
                 repeatedly biopsied by gonopore cannulation from the
                 same females (n = 3) throughout oogenesis. Reproductive
                 status of initial biopsies was confirmed as being
                 previtellogenic and that in biopsies collected eight
                 weeks later as early vitellogenic. A de novo h{\=a}puku
                 transcriptome was assembled (146,189 transcripts) from
                 RNA-Seq data without a reference genome. On average,
                 each tissue sample contained 17.5 million trimmed
                 reads. Gene annotation was 80\% when using BLASTX
                 against Genbank Non Redundant database. Fifty-three
                 transcripts were differentially expressed within the
                 FDR of 0.05 when previtellogenic and early vitellogenic
                 ovaries were compared; this reduced to 35
                 differentially expressed genes when transcript
                 duplications were pooled. Among these were genes

                 related with several side-effects on marine fish
                 performance, health, or disease resistance. Physical
                 barriers of the skin, gills, and gut constitute the
                 primary defense mechanism of fish. Skin mucus mucosal
                 mucins, water, proteins, ions, and lipids determine the
                 physical, chemical, and protective characteristics of
                 skin mucus. Very little is known about the influence of
                 diet composition on fish skin mucus fatty acid profile.
                 Gilthead sea bream skin mucus contained 10\% of total
                 lipids (TL), which consisted of 50--60\% neutral (NL)

                 {\Sigma}n{-}6LC-PUFA accumulation was similar in both
                 lipid classes. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:{6n-3})
                 was the main LC-PUFA stored in skin mucus (14\% TL) in
                 relation to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:{5n-3})

                 parasitic nematodes of the family Anisakidae, of which
                 the species belonging to \bioname{Anisakis simplex}
                 complex are the most representative. It is considered
                 an emerging disease in Spain. The objective of this
                 study is to analyse the presence of larvae in fish
                 frequently consumed in Spanish supermarkets, inferring
                 the risk of infection. In total 1,786 specimens of 9
                 different fish species, from two geographical origins
                 (Atlantic and Mediterranean), acquired fresh and not
                 eviscerated were examined for anisakid nematodes.
                 Analysis showed that 33.7\% of the samples were
                 parasitized by Anisakis larvae. The horse mackerel
                 (\bioname{Trachurus trachurus}) presented the highest
                 total prevalence (66.0\%), followed by the silver hake
                 (\bioname{Merluccius bilinearis}) (59.5\%), the
                 mackerel (\bioname{Scomber scombrus}) (58.4\%), the
                 blue whiting (\bioname{Micromesistius poutassou})
                 (53.9\%) and the European hake (Merlucius merlucius)
                 (45.0\%). In general, the prevalence was higher in
                 Atlantic than in Mediterranean fish. In all the species
                 analysed, a higher presence of the parasite was
                 detected in the viscera than in the flesh, although in
                 the most parasitized species a noteworthy prevalence
                 and abundance was observed in the flesh. In conclusion,
                 risk factors, like fish species and origin, should be
                 considered by consumers, in addition of following the

                 try to sell the new species in their firms' domestic
                 markets, but they might also look at other markets.
                 However, as markets are becoming more global and
                 competitors more international, considering
                 internationalization may be a necessity rather than a
                 choice. Using diffusion modelling, and based on results
                 of an online supermarket experiment, the innovation and

                 different internationalization strategies (i.e.

                 waterfall strategy refers to the sequential

                 the sprinkler strategy concerns the simultaneous
                 introduction of a product in multiple international
                 markets. Since a sprinkler approach requires many
                 resources and the ability to quickly ramp up production
                 capacity, a waterfall approach appears more suitable
                 for farmers of greater amberjack. Italy and Spain

  abstract =     "Among the many anthropogenic chemicals that end up in
                 the aquatic ecosystem, heavy metals, in particular
                 cadmium, are hazardous compounds that have been shown
                 to affect developmental, reproductive, hepatic,
                 hematological, and immunological functions in teleost
                 fish. There is also evidence that cadmium disturbs bone
                 formation and skeletal development, but data is scarce.
                 In this work, zebrafish was used to further
                 characterize the anti-osteogenic/osteotoxic effects of
                 cadmium and gain insights into underlying mechanisms.
                 Upon exposure to cadmium, a reduction of the opercular
                 bone growth was observed in 6-days post-fertilization
                 (dpf) larvae and an increase in the incidence of
                 skeletal deformities was evidenced in 20-dpf
                 post-larvae. The extent and stiffness of newly formed
                 bone was also affected in adult zebrafish exposed to
                 cadmium while regenerating their caudal fin. A pathway
                 reporter assay revealed a possible role of the MTF-1
                 and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways in mechanisms of
                 cadmium osteotoxicity, while the expression of genes
                 involved in osteoblast differentiation and matrix
                 production was strongly reduced in cadmium-exposed
                 post-larvae. This work not only confirmed cadmium
                 anti-osteogenic activity and identified targeted
                 pathways and genes, but it also suggested that cadmium
                 may affect biomechanical properties of bone.",

                 gear in coastal countries. Due to its resilience, it
                 has withstood heavy fishing pressure in the past few
                 decades. Coastal drifting gillnet fleets also mark

                 provides new information on an abundance index based on
                 fishery-dependent data from 2010 to 2017. Generalized
                 linear models (GLMs) were used to standardize the

                 capacity. While the CPUE series fluctuated greatly, it

  abstract =     "Global consumption of seafood is steadily increasing,
                 as is the variety of seafood, including dishes with raw
                 or undercooked fish, leading to an increased risk of
                 seafood-borne parasitic diseases. To address today's
                 challenges to understand the biology and ecology of
                 these parasites in an ever-changing environment and to
                 tackle their pathogenicity, multidisciplinary research
                 is needed. In addition, the gap between research and
                 stakeholders must be bridged to decrease the risk these
                 parasites pose to public health. A ``One-Health''
                 approach to research is necessary to ensure that
                 consumers, aquatic animals, and environmental health
                 questions are assessed in an integrated and holistic
                 manner, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding
                 of the issues associated with seafood-borne parasitic
                 diseases and potential solutions. However, when it
                 comes to seafood-borne parasitic diseases, there is
                 limited guidance available for a ``One-Health''
                 approach since these diseases can be less known. In
                 this article, the focus is on parasitic diseases caused
                 by seafood, which have been less studied even in some
                 developed countries where seafood is popular. A brief
                 overview of some of the seafood-borne parasitic
                 diseases is provided followed by the significance of
                 the awareness among various stakeholders in a country.
                 In this article, it is argued that researchers and
                 stakeholders are closely connected and a knowledge gap
                 in one can result in a gap in knowledge and awareness
                 in the other, causing an inability to accurately
                 estimate the issues caused by these parasites. It is
                 suggested that raising awareness, supporting research
                 and training of all stakeholders are crucial for the
                 prevention of seafood-borne parasitic diseases and the
                 protection of the health of seafood consumers.",

                 refinement that will ensure the good condition of
                 animals used in experimentation. The present study
                 investigated the impact of invasive procedures on the
                 patterns of movement of zebrafish (\bioname{Danio
                 rerio}). Recordings were made before and after fin
                 clipping, PIT tagging and a standard pain test and
                 these were compared with control and sham handled
                 zebrafish. The fractal dimension (FD) from the 3D
                 trajectories was calculated to determine the effect of
                 these treatments on the complexity of movement
                 patterns. While the FD of zebrafish trajectories did
                 not differ over time in either the control or sham
                 group, the FDs of the treatment groups reduced in
                 complexity. The FD of fish injected with different
                 strengths of acetic acid declined in a dose-dependent
                 manner allowing us to develop an arbitrary scale of
                 severity of the treatments. The 3D trajectory plots
                 from some groups indicated the presence of repetitive
                 swimming patterns akin to stereotypical movements. When
                 administered with lidocaine, which has analgesic
                 properties, the movement complexity of fin clipped fish
                 reverted to a pattern that resembled that of control
                 fish. Fractal analysis of zebrafish locomotion could
                 potentially be adopted as a tool for fish welfare
                 assessment.",

  abstract =     "Coastal predatory fish are of key importance for the
                 provisioning of ecosystem services in the Baltic Sea.
                 Worldwide, however, there has been a general and sharp
                 decline in predatory fish populations, in turn
                 threatening the viability and function of marine
                 ecosystems. On the basis of the literature, the past
                 (data until the 2000s) and current (data until early
                 and mid 2010s) trends in abundance of coastal predatory
                 fish in the Baltic Sea are reviewed in this paper.
                 Potentially important impacting factors behind the
                 temporal development of the populations and measures to
                 strengthen and restore them are also discussed.
                 Available data from coastal fish monitoring programs
                 suggest a stable or increasing abundance of coastal
                 predatory fish as a functional group and for the
                 species perch in the majority of areas assessed in the
                 Baltic Sea. For pike and pikeperch, data to support
                 assessments is scarce, but suggest substantial declines
                 in the abundance of both species in most assessed
                 areas. The impacting factors behind these patterns vary
                 between species and areas, but include climate, habitat
                 exploitation, fishing, and species-interactions in the
                 coastal food web. Measures to restore and support
                 coastal predatory fish communities should follow an
                 ecosystem-based approach to management and include
                 efforts to regulate fisheries sectors in combination
                 with habitat protection and restoration.",

                 fish in Mediterranean countries, seasonally migrates
                 from offshore areas to estuaries for reproduction.
                 During the first two years of life, the meagre
                 evidences a certain grade of euryhalinity by staying in
                 brackish waters close to the shore. The aim of the
                 present study was to establish if fingerling growth in
                 brackish water is improved compared to seawater, where
                 current culture procedures are conducted.
                 Three-month-old fingerlings were maintained for 45 days
                 under two different salinity regimens (12 and 39 ppt).
                 Several growth parameters as well as osmoregulatory and

                 significantly affected skin coloration, swimming
                 activity and external injuries, with the palest and
                 inactive fish combined with most external injuries in
                 the P120 group. Mineral and protein contents in the
                 fish remained unaffected, while fat content inside the
                 fillets enriched with increasing PO 4 {3-} -P.
                 Inorganic P in blood plasma increased significantly,
                 while phosphate concentrations inside the fillet
                 remained unchanged. We suggest that PO 4 {3-} -P
                 concentrations of 40 to 80 mg L {-1} do not reduce the
                 performance of African catfish aquaculture, while
                 increased values of 120 mg L {-1} affect fish welfare.
                 This allows limited addition of PO 4 {3-} -P fertilizer
                 in coupled aquaponics with African catfish to support
                 plant growth.",

  abstract =     "The skin, gills, and gut are the most extensively
                 studied mucosal organs in fish. These mucosal
                 structures provide the intimate interface between the
                 internal and external milieus and serve as the
                 indispensable first line of defense. They have highly
                 diverse physiological functions. Their role in defense
                 can be highlighted in three shared similarities: their
                 microanatomical structures that serve as the physical
                 barrier and hold the immune cells and the effector
                 molecules; the mucus layer, also a physical barrier,
                 contains an array of potent bioactive molecules; and
                 the resident microbiota. Mucosal surfaces are
                 responsive and plastic to the different changes in the
                 aquatic environment. The direct interaction of the
                 mucosa with the environment offers some important
                 information on both the physiological status of the
                 host and the conditions of the aquatic environment.
                 Increasing attention has been directed to these
                 features in the last year, particularly on how to
                 improve the overall health of the fish through
                 manipulation of mucosal functions and on how the
                 changes in the mucosa, in response to varying
                 environmental factors, can be harnessed to improve
                 husbandry. In this short review, we highlight the
                 current knowledge on how mucosal surfaces respond to
                 various environmental factors relevant to aquaculture
                 and how they may be exploited in fostering sustainable
                 fish farming practices, especially in controlled

  abstract =     "Viviparity in teleosts involves, invariably, the ovary
                 in a gestational role. This type of viviparity is due
                 to the combination of unique aspects, different from
                 those found in the rest of vertebrates. These aspects
                 are: the ovary has a saccular structure; the germinal
                 epithelium lines the ovarian lumen; the absence of
                 oviducts; and the intraovarian insemination,
                 fertilization, and gestation. The communication of the
                 germinal zone of the ovary to the exterior is via the
                 caudal zone of the ovary---the gonoduct. The germinal
                 epithelium is composed of oogonia and oocytes scattered
                 individually or in cell nests among somatic epithelial
                 cells. In the ovarian stroma the follicles are included
                 which are formed by the oocyte, which is surrounded by
                 follicular cells and the vascularized theca. The
                 oogenesis comprises three stages: chromatin-nucleolus,
                 previtellogenesis, and vitellogenesis. There is no
                 ovulation, as the oocyte is retained in the follicle.
                 During the insemination, the spermatozoa enter into the
                 ovarian lumen and the intrafollicular fertilization
                 occurs, followed by intrafollicular gestation. The
                 intraovarian gestation of poeciliids involves
                 morphological characteristics associated with the
                 intrafollicular embryogenesis and types of nutrition,
                 such as lecithotrophy and matrotrophy. In
                 lecithotrophy, the nutrients come from the yolk
                 reserves stored during oogenesis, whereas in
                 matrotrophy the nutrients are provided by supplies from
                 maternal tissues to the embryo during gestation. The
                 maternal--embryonic metabolic interchanges converge
                 through the development of the association of maternal
                 and embryonic blood vessels, establishing a follicular

                 assess differences between two types of traps for adult
                 sea lamprey (\bioname{Petromyzon marinus}),
                 submerged-funnel traps and studded-tile traps, which
                 are angled ramps with trickle flow leading out of the
                 water. The studded-tile trap at one river caught about
                 50\% more females than the funnel trap. It caught males
                 that had a smaller body size and females with a lower
                 gonado-somatic index (GSI). The likelihood of catching
                 lamprey in the studded-tile trap increased after they
                 had been caught once. This was not the case for the
                 funnel traps, which are used for mark--recapture-based
                 population assessment of invasive sea lamprey in the
                 Great Lakes. The apparent trap response caused by
                 studded-tile traps may have been caused by a behavioral
                 bias, i.e., the traps consistently attracting a subset
                 of the population. Use of the studded-tile trap for
                 population assessment should only be considered after
                 more is known about its recapture bias. The differences
                 between lamprey caught in the two trap types suggests
                 that a variety of trapping methods needs to be employed
                 in order to get a representative sample from a fish

  abstract =     "Alaska's salmon fisheries are one of the more
                 intensely managed natural resources in the world. The
                 state's salmon fisheries support recreational,
                 subsistence, and commercial harvest with multiple
                 billions of dollars flowing into the economy, and
                 define the cultural identity of many Alaskans. Fishery
                 management practices rely on historic records to set
                 policies with two goals: to meet salmon escapement
                 quota and to maximize salmon harvest. At the same time,
                 rapid social and ecological changes to the sub-Arctic
                 are already impacting salmon runs and fisheries
                 management. Combined with the inability of fishery
                 managers to test the outcome of proposed policy
                 changes, an understanding of the role social and
                 ecological drivers play in harvest and effort is
                 required. To address the two-forked problem of
                 understanding socio-ecological dynamics and potential
                 policy responses to ecological and social changes, we
                 (1) conducted stakeholder workshops to solicit key
                 system drivers, (2) built an integrated agent based
                 model (ABM) of the system's socio-ecological dynamics,
                 and (3) tested the impacts of alternative future
                 scenarios of ecological, social, and policy changes on
                 the system's outcomes. We previously constructed and
                 validated a high-fidelity, data-driven, agent-based
                 model of the Kenai River, Alaska that simulates
                 seasonal harvest of sockeye and {Chinook} salmon, the
                 fishing activities of the personal use fishery,
                 commercial drift, and set gillnet agents. We study the
                 role of key stakeholder and ecological drivers, using
                 the ABM decision support tool, and their implications
                 for fisheries management policies. Analysis of the
                 scenario based studies found resilience in management
                 of commercial fisheries to changing salmon migration
                 dynamics, a lack of adaptive capacity in recreational
                 (personal use) dipnet users to altered sockeye salmon
                 runs, and the possible utility of introducing
                 management measures in the dipnet fishery to manipulate
                 sockeye escapement levels. These findings represent the
                 usefulness of this type of ABM in assisting fishery
                 managers everywhere in investigating possible future
                 outcomes of different management or ecological
                 scenarios.",

                 volume. The results from fish that were exposed to P.
                 parvum showed a significant decrease in oxygen
                 extraction (median {\pm} SD; 52.6 {\pm} 6.9 percentage
                 points) from pre-exposure to the end of the experiment,
                 as opposed to fish exposed to R. salina, which were
                 unaffected. These results indicate that suffocation
                 affects the European plaice when exposed to P. parvum.
                 The observed severe decrease in oxygen extraction can
                 be ascribed to either damage of the gill epithelia or
                 increased mucus secretion on the gills, as both would
                 limit the transfer of oxygen, and both have been
                 observed.",

  abstract =     "Traditional animal welfare paradigms have focused on
                 maintaining physical health and mitigating negative
                 impacts to wellbeing. Recently, however, the field has
                 increasingly recognized the importance of positive
                 welfare (i.e., mental and physical states that exceed
                 what is necessary for immediate survival) and
                 accordingly introduced manipulations and indicators of
                 positive welfare for use in agriculture, laboratories,
                 and zoos/aquaria. The creation and monitoring of
                 positive welfare requires an in-depth knowledge of
                 species-specific behavior and biology, which
                 necessitates species-specific or, at a minimum,
                 taxa-specific standards. Research on positive welfare
                 in fish is lagging in this regard and therefore merits
                 further consideration. In this paper, we aim to merge
                 what is already known about positive welfare with the
                 existing fish behavior literature to develop a plan of
                 action for fish welfare research that will ultimately
                 contribute to the development of positive welfare
                 standards and assessment strategies for fish. We begin
                 by exploring the origins of positive welfare research
                 and then outline the physical, psychological and
                 species-specific areas of inquiry that can be
                 investigated in fish. In addition to presenting current
                 findings on fish motivation, emotion, potential sources
                 of positive welfare such as fulfillment of motivational
                 urges (establishing agency, engaging in exploration and
                 learning), and play behavior, we also identify
                 promising areas for future research aimed at developing
                 accurate and appropriate indicators of positive welfare
                 in fish.",

  abstract =     "Fish welfare is an essential issue that needs to be
                 tackled by the aquaculture industry. In order to
                 address it, studies have been limited to a small number
                 of species and the information is generally scattered.
                 In order to have a consistent overview of the welfare
                 of farmed fishes, we present the FishEthoBase, an
                 open-access database that ultimately aims to provide
                 information on the welfare of all fish species
                 currently farmed worldwide. Presently with 41 species,
                 this database is directed to all stakeholders in the
                 field and targets not only to bridge the gaps between
                 them but also to provide scientific information to
                 improve the welfare of fish. The current text explains
                 the database and presents an analysis of the welfare
                 scores of 41 species, suggesting that (i) the general
                 welfare state of farmed fishes is poor, (ii) there is
                 some potential for improvement and (iii) this potential
                 is related to research on species' needs, but (iv)
                 there are many remaining knowledge gaps and (v) current
                 fish farming technologies do not seem to fully address
                 welfare issues. The existence of a framework, such as
                 the FishEthoBase, is proposed as fundamental to the
                 design of strategies that improve the welfare of farmed

  abstract =     "The movement of fish can be regulated by behavioural
                 manipulation through non-physical barrier systems.
                 Aquatic invasive species are becoming one of the major
                 management issues in North America, and threaten native
                 aquatic ecosystems, including freshwater fish.
                 Placements of non-physical barriers in waterways can
                 help disrupt the movement of invasive fish. This study
                 examined the effect of a strobe-light stimulus on the
                 avoidance behaviour of two proxy species, juvenile
                 common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus carpio}) and juvenile
                 channel catfish (\bioname{Ictalurus punctatus}), in a
                 controlled laboratory environment. For each species,
                 three sequential treatments of pre-stimulus,
                 strobe-light stimulus, and post-stimulus for 30 min
                 periods were recorded on acclimated groups of 5
                 juvenile common carp and 5 juvenile channel catfish
                 using 15 and 13 replicates, respectively. The
                 distribution of juvenile common carp individuals
                 throughout the tank did not change significantly with
                 treatment, nor did cohesive grouping behaviour.
                 Similarly, there were no significant differences across
                 experimental treatments in average location/distance of
                 juvenile channel catfish relative to the strobe light
                 or degree of cohesion in response to the strobe light.
                 Non-physical barriers have been widely reported to vary
                 between species and environmental conditions. These
                 results suggest that strobe lights evoke no avoidance
                 or attractive responses in juvenile common carp and
                 juvenile channel catfish, and will likely not be an
                 effective barrier to inhibit movements of juvenile
                 invasive fishes.",

  abstract =     "Many species rely on acoustic communication to fulfil
                 several functions such as advertisement and mediation
                 of social interactions (e.g., agonistic, mating).
                 Therefore, fish calls can be an important source of
                 information, e.g., to recognize reproductive periods or
                 to assess fish welfare, and should be considered a
                 potential non-intrusive tool in aquaculture management.
                 Assessing fish acoustic activity, however, often
                 requires long sound recordings. To analyse these long
                 recordings automatic methods are invaluable tools to
                 detect and extract the relevant biological information.
                 Here we present a study to characterize meagre
                 (\bioname{Argyrosomus regius}) acoustic activity during
                 social contexts in captivity using an automatic
                 pattern-recognition methodology based on the Hidden
                 Markov Model. Calls produced by meagre during the
                 breading season showed a richer repertoire than
                 previously reported. Besides the dense choruses
                 composed by grunts already known for this species,
                 meagre emitted successive series of isolated pulses,
                 audible as `knocks'. Grunts with a variable number of
                 pulses were also registered. The overall acoustic
                 activity was concurrent with the number of spawning
                 events. A diel call rhythms exhibit peak of calling
                 activity from 15:00 to midnight. In addition, grunt
                 acoustic parameters varied significantly along the
                 reproduction season. These results open the possibility
                 to use the meagre vocal activity to predict breeding
                 and approaching spawning periods in aquaculture
                 management.",

                 hypothesis that the Silver Carp
                 (\bioname{Hypophthalmichthys molitrix}), an invasive
                 river carp from China, employs a prostaglandin F
                 2{\alpha} -derived sex pheromone that is attractive and
                 species-specific. Using electro-olfactogram recording
                 (EOG), we found that the olfactory system of this
                 species is acutely sensitive to three F-series
                 prostaglandins (PGFs) at picomolar concentrations and
                 that this sensitivity is enhanced when juveniles are
                 masculinized using androgens, consistent with
                 expectations of a sex pheromone. Individual PGFs had
                 behavioral activity but it was low, suggesting a
                 mixture might be important. To pursue this possibility,
                 we implanted carps with osmotic pumps containing
                 prostaglandin F 2{\alpha} (PGF 2{\alpha}), a treatment
                 previously shown to elicit release of a PGF-based
                 spawning pheromone in the Common Carp. We found that
                 PGF 2{\alpha} -implanted Silver Carp released a
                 species-specific odor that contained a blend of PGF
                 2{\alpha} and two of its metabolites, which
                 masculinized individuals detected and were attracted to
                 with high sensitivity. Finally, we found that a mixture
                 of these PGFs was attractive to masculinized Silver
                 Carp, while a different mixture released by Bighead
                 Carp was not. We conclude that Silver Carp likely use a
                 species-specific PGF 2{\alpha} -derived sex pheromone
                 that is probably released at spawning and might be
                 useful in its control. Confirmatory studies that
                 explore pheromone function in naturally mature Silver
                 Carp using natural odors in the field should now be
                 conducted to further confirm our proof-of-concept

                 treatments for this disease on marine fish produced in
                 semi-intensive aquaculture has led to a new welfare
                 approach to amyloodiniosis. There is already some
                 knowledge of several welfare issues that lead to
                 amyloodiniosis as well as the stress, physiological,
                 and immunological responses to the parasite by the
                 host, but no work is available about the influence of
                 fish age on the progression of amyloodiniosis. The
                 objective of this work was to determine if stress,
                 hematological, and histopathological responses are age
                 dependent. For that purpose, we determined the

                 mechanisms that determine the differences in the rate
                 of aging. A mass spectrometric metabolic profiling of
                 skeletal muscle of fish with various aging rates was
                 carried out by direct injection to a quadrupole

                 acids, lipids, biogenic amines, intermediates of
                 glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and citric acid cycle.

  abstract =     "Fish social behavior can be affected by artificial
                 environments, particularly by factors that act upon
                 species that show aggressive behavior to set social
                 rank hierarchy. Although aggressive interactions are
                 part of the natural behavior in fish, if constant and
                 intense, such interactions can cause severe body
                 injuries, increase energy expenditure, and lead the
                 animals to suffer from social stress. The immediate
                 consequence of these factors is a reduced welfare in
                 social fish species. In this paper, we consider the
                 factors that impact on the social behavior and welfare
                 of Nile tilapia, an African cichlid fish widely used
                 both in fish farms and in research; this species is
                 frequently used as a model for physiology and behavior
                 research. This is a polygynous species whose males
                 interact aggressively, establishing a territorial based
                 hierarchy, where a dominant male and several
                 subordinate males arise. When social stability is
                 shrunk, the negative effects of prolonged fighting
                 emerge. In this paper, we summarized how some of the
                 common practices in aquaculture, such as classifying
                 individuals by matching their sizes, water renewal,
                 stock density, and environment lighting affect Nile
                 tilapia social aggressive interactions and, in turn,
                 impact on its welfare. We also discuss some ways to
                 decrease the effects of aggressive interactions in Nile
                 tilapia, such as environment color and body tactile
                 stimulation.",

                 are widely used industrial chemicals, ubiquitously
                 present in the environment. While BPA is a well-known
                 endocrine disruptor and able to affect all levels of
                 the teleost reproductive axis, information regarding
                 TBBPA on this subject is very limited. Using primary
                 cultures from Atlantic cod (\bioname{Gadus morhua}),
                 the present study was aimed at investigating potential
                 direct effects of acute (72 h) BPA and TBBPA exposure
                 on cell viability and the expression of
                 reproductive-relevant genes in the pituitary. The
                 results revealed that both bisphenols stimulate cell
                 viability in terms of metabolic activity and membrane
                 integrity at environmentally relevant concentrations.
                 BPA had no direct effects on gonadotropin gene
                 expression, but enhanced the expression of
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor 2a, the
                 main gonadotropin modulator in Atlantic cod. In
                 contrast, TBBPA increased gonadotropin transcript
                 levels but had no effect on GnRH receptor mRNA. In
                 conclusion, both anthropogenic compounds display
                 endocrine disruptive properties and are able to
                 directly interfere with gene expression related to
                 reproductive function in cod pituitary cells at

                 was greater for barbel (60\% and 25\% for barbel and
                 nase, respectively). Differences in passage efficiency
                 between species may be due to differences in their
                 size. Mean length for barbels attempting to pass was
                 336 mm ({\pm}47 mm) while for nases was 143 mm ({\pm}26
                 mm). Moreover, both the number of attempts to pass and
                 ascend time for nases were higher than for barbels.
                 Entrance efficiency was low (3.5\% and 10.8\% for
                 barbel and nase, respectively), although 2017 was a
                 very dry year, thus these results are most likely
                 influenced by flow rates. Therefore, the fishway has
                 proved to be functional but is actually poor for
                 efficiency purposes, especially for small fish.",

                 margate, Anisotremus surinamensis (n = 130) were
                 determined using sectioned sagittal otoliths collected
                 from the Southeastern {United States} Atlantic coast
                 from 1979 to 2017. Opaque zones were annular, forming
                 between January and June for both species, with peaks
                 in occurrence of otoliths with opaque margins in April
                 for margate and March for black margate. The observed
                 ages for margate were 0--22 years, and the largest fish
                 measured 807 mm TL (total length). Black margate ranged
                 in age from 3 to 17 years, and the largest fish was 641
                 mm TL. Weight--length relationships were: margate,

                 margate. After re-estimating black margate growth using
                 a bias-correction procedure to account for the lack of
                 younger fish, growth was described by the equation L t
                 = 523 (1 {-} e {-0}.18(t+0.0001)). Age-invariant
                 estimates of natural mortality were M = 0.19 y {-1} and
                 M = 0.23 y {-1} for margate and black margate,

                 sedentary behavior, which depends on the animals' body
                 size, is unknown. Our objective was to analyze, for two
                 years, the changes in the home range of a population of
                 European eel (\bioname{Anguilla anguilla}, Linnaeus,
                 1758) in Southern Europe in relation to the animals'
                 body length (TL), and the influence of environmental
                 factors (water temperature and flow) on the local
                 movements of this population through observation of
                 their sedentary behavior. We used a
                 previously-validated mark--recapture methodology,
                 obtaining a low deviation in the estimation of the
                 extension of the eels' movements. Our results revealed
                 relatively short movements in relation to other
                 populations, and we hypothesize that this could be
                 related to the high habitat diversity and low eel
                 population density in the study area. The home range
                 size showed a high variability and dispersion among the
                 smallest eels, however, as TL increased, the
                 variability of home range size decreased, and home
                 ranges were larger. These changes could be associated
                 with the acquisition of a sedentary lifestyle. Once
                 eels had become sedentary, an environmental pattern was
                 observed between their movements and the water
                 temperature and flow, with larger movements observed as
                 the flow increased and water temperature decreased.
                 This suggests that the temporal and spatial scales of
                 observation are of crucial importance for monitoring
                 eel populations and for the study of population size
                 structure, population dynamics, and biology, which can
                 be used to improve conservation strategies.",

                 females fail to undergo oocyte maturation and spawn or
                 produce poor quality eggs. This study investigated
                 whether administration of a synthetic agonist of
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) could improve F1
                 h{\=a}puku spawning and complete the life-cycle in
                 captivity. Spawning trials were conducted over 2 years
                 in 2013 and 2014, when F1 were aged five and six years.
                 In 2013, females previously conditioned under a
                 variable or constant temperature regime were implanted
                 with GnRHa (100 {\mu}g/kg {-1}) or blank implants
                 constructed of powdered cellulose and cholesterol.
                 Spawning was erratic and egg quality very poor in all
                 tanks. No F2 offspring were produced by communal
                 spawning. In contrast, viable F2 larvae were produced
                 by strip-spawning and in vitro fertilization after a
                 series of GnRHa injections. In 2014, two additional
                 trials were conducted: females received ethylene-vinyl
                 acetate copolymer (EVAc) matrix implants containing
                 GnRHa (100 {\mu}g/kg {-1}) or blank implants and in the
                 second trial, two GnRHa doses (100 {\mu}g/kg {-1} and
                 50 {\mu}g/kg {-1}) were tested. Eggs were first
                 detected in all tanks 12--17 days post-implantation
                 when females received 100 $ \mu $ g/kg {-1} GnRHa
                 implants, but not in the lower dose or control tanks.
                 In summary, this study achieved induction of female
                 spawning with GnRHa implants (target dose 100 {\mu}g/kg

                 (FM) as a sustainable protein source in aquaculture
                 feed that does not negatively impact the marine
                 ecosystem. Despite housefly (Musca domestica) larvae
                 having adequacy of amino acid profiles, they have
                 sometimes been reported to be inferior to FM,
                 especially for marine carnivorous fish species. Here,
                 we report that the removal of the hydrophobic fractions
                 from housefly larvae enables significant replacement of
                 FM in the diet of the red seabream (\bioname{Pagrus
                 major}). In a feeding trial, housefly (HF) larvae that
                 had the hydrophobic fraction removed as a complete
                 substitution for 70\% FM produced satisfactory growth.
                 However, HF larvae that were supplemented with the
                 hydrophobic fraction resulted in significant growth
                 reduction. Growth recovery was incomplete by
                 supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and
                 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to undefatted HF larvae,
                 being equivalent to that of fatty acid content with a
                 control diet. Moreover, fish with a dietary intake of
                 catechol identified from the hydrophobic fraction of
                 the HF showed growth reduction and morphological
                 alterations in the intestine. Our findings indicate
                 that the hydrophobic fraction from HF larvae contains a
                 negative factor for fish growth and eliminating the
                 fraction from HF larvae is thought to be an important
                 process for sustainable aquaculture.",

                 gene expression increased in L25 whereas GHR-II, IGF-II
                 and MyoG were higher in L6. IGF-I and MSTN expression
                 was not affected by the different diets. Adipose IGF-I

                 weight and members of GH/IGF system in liver and

                 Correlations found in L10 group between both liver and
                 skeletal muscle GHR-I and IGF-I were lost in either L6
                 or L25 groups. Thus, fish fed with apparently
                 unbalanced dietary lipid contents (6\% and 25\%)
                 exhibit a compensatory regulation of systemic and local
                 components of the GH/IGF axis. Furthermore, the marked
                 inhibition of muscle MyoG gene expression in L25 might
                 limit excessive lipid deposition and fish growth. Our
                 data suggest that a dietary lipid contents of 10\%
                 would promote a particular adjustment of the endocrine
                 and autocrine/paracrine GH/IGF system, stimulating body
                 growth and perhaps muscle hyperplasia. On the other
                 hand, a higher dietary lipid content would uncouple the
                 GH/IGF system, reducing hepatic IGF-I, while slightly
                 increasing hepatic GHR-I, probably to prompt
                 lipolysis.",

                 less than the expected range of 280--292 m, and was not
                 found to be significantly impacted by wind speed. There
                 was evidence of a hydropower effect on detection
                 probability (up to 95\% reduction) of both tag types

                 Freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most biodiverse,
                 containing about 50\% of the world's known fish species
                 but, ironically, are the most invaded ecosystems. In
                 Portuguese freshwaters, there are currently 20
                 identified non-native fishes, arriving at an
                 unprecedented rate of a new species every two years. A
                 recent non-native is the European catfish
                 \bioname{Silurus glanis}, a top predator native to
                 Central and Eastern Europe, that arrived at the Lower
                 Tagus (Portugal) circa 2006. This study compares the
                 dietary habits of this top predator in two different
                 habitats of the Lower Tagus in order to evaluate its
                 potential impact. The stomach contents of 96
                 individuals were analyzed, 61 from the lotic
                 environment and 35 from the lentic systems. A total of
                 66 stomachs contained prey items, 38 from the lotic and

  abstract =     "Although it is well known that the biological and
                 physical characteristics of skin mucus in fishes are
                 strongly affected by changes in environmental
                 conditions, the influence of photoperiod and
                 time-dependent bacterial endotoxin stimulation is not
                 well documented. In the present study, we determined
                 the diel variations in the basal activities of
                 secretory proteins with known defense functions in the
                 skin mucus of Nile tilapia (\bioname{Oreochromis
                 niloticus}) maintained under two photic environments:
                 equal length of day and night (12L:12D, LD) or total
                 darkness (0L:24D, DD). A second experiment was
                 conducted to determine how time-dependent (i.e., day
                 versus night) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge could
                 influence these skin mucosal defenses. The results
                 revealed that LD signal differentially modulated the
                 activities of mucosal immune molecules. Fish subjected
                 to LD regime showed significantly higher levels of skin
                 mucus lysozyme and protease at nighttime than at
                 daytime. This distinct feature was not observed in fish
                 under DD. There was no general mucosal response
                 patterns to time-dependent LPS challenge. Nonetheless,
                 protease and lysozyme, which were identified to be at
                 elevated levels at night, were significantly modulated
                 when the endotoxin was administered at nighttime.
                 Ceruloplasmin was the only molecule that responded to
                 LPS challenge at daytime, where its activity
                 significantly increased at 8 h post-stimulation.
                 Collectively, the results revealed that photoperiod
                 cues influenced the activities of mucosal defenses and
                 this may play, at least in part, in the temporal
                 sensitivity to bacterial endotoxin.",

                 interest for aquaculture due to their omnivorous
                 profile, rapid growth, and resistance to environmental
                 variations. The selection of feed ingredients for these
                 species is currently focused on an extensive use of
                 plant by-products, with this being limited by their

                 specific enzymes can be used to counteract some of
                 those negative effects. In the present study, the
                 effect of pretreating two high-plant feeds with a
                 mixture of enzymes (glucanases + phytase) on the

                 increased the digestibility of protein in one of the

                 and nourishment, leading to growth arrest and a halt in

                 implications of central core control during the cold
                 season. The aim of this work was to study the effects
                 of low temperature and recovery from such exposure on
                 the pituitary activity of sea bream juveniles fed 18\%
                 or 14\% dietary lipid. A controlled indoor trial was
                 performed to simulate natural temperature fluctuation
                 (22 {$^\circ $}C to 14 {$^\circ $}C to 22 {$^\circ
                 $}C). Meanwhile, we determined the regulatory role of
                 the pituitary by analyzing the gene expression of some
                 pituitary hormones and hormone receptors via qPCR, as
                 well as plasma levels of thyroidal hormones. In
                 response to higher dietary lipids, hormone pituitary
                 expressions were up-regulated. Induced low temperatures
                 and lower ingesta modulated pituitary function
                 up-regulating GH and TSH and thyroid and glucocorticoid
                 receptors. All these findings demonstrate the capacity
                 of the pituitary to recognize both external conditions
                 and to modulate its response accordingly. However,
                 growth, peripheral tissues and metabolism were not
                 linked or connected to pituitary function at low
                 temperatures, which opens an interesting field of study

                 is a model for hormonal control of reproduction in
                 Anabantidae fish, but also relevant to other
                 vertebrates. We analyzed the female blue gourami brain
                 transcriptome in two developmental stages:
                 pre-vitellogenesis (PVTL) before yolk accumulation in
                 the oocytes, and high vitellogenesis (HVTL) at the end
                 of yolk accumulation in the oocytes. RNA sequencing of
                 whole-brain transcriptome identified 34,368 unique
                 transcripts, 23,710 of which could be annotated by
                 homology with other species. We focused on the
                 transcripts showing significant differences between the
                 stages. Seventeen and fourteen annotated genes were
                 found to be upregulated in PVTL and HVTL, respectively.
                 Five nuclear transcripts, three of which contain the
                 homeobox domain (ARX, DLX5, CERS6), were upregulated in
                 PVTL. Additionally, several receptors previously known
                 to be involved in reproduction were identified, and
                 three of these, G-protein coupled receptor 54, Membrane
                 progesterone receptor epsilon, and
                 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone II receptor (GPCR, mPR,
                 and GnRHR) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR in
                 brain, pituitary, and ovary samples from PVTL and HVTL
                 stage females. Of these, GPCR was highly expressed in
                 the brain and pituitary as compared to the ovary in
                 both PVTL and HVTL. GnRHR was highly expressed in the
                 ovary compared to the brain and pituitary, and its
                 levels in the brain were significantly higher in PVTL
                 than HVTL. Brain mPR mRNA levels were likewise higher
                 in PVTL than HVTL. In conclusion, this study details
                 changes in the female blue gourami brain transcriptome
                 through yolk accumulation in the oocytes and identifies
                 key genes that may mediate this process.",

                 Genetic results indicated that ten males maintained
                 guardianship over their nest territories for up to nine
                 nest cycles during a 3.5 month period. Genotypes of
                 1025 offspring sampled from 68 nests (composed of 129
                 clutches) were consistent with 95\% of the offspring
                 being sired by the guardian male. Offspring lacking
                 paternal alleles at two or more loci were found in 19
                 clutches, indicating that reproductive parasitism and
                 subsequent alloparental care occurred. Reconstructed
                 maternal genotypes allowed the identification of a
                 minimum of 74 different females that spawned with these
                 ten territorial males. Males were polygynous, mating
                 with multiple females within and between cycles.
                 Genetic data from nests, which consisted of up to four
                 clutches during a reproductive cycle, indicated that
                 each clutch usually had only one maternal contributor
                 and that different clutches each had different dams.
                 Females displayed sequential polyandry spawning with
                 one male within a cycle but switched males in
                 subsequent spawning cycles. These results highlight new

                 induce advanced stages of oogenesis in freshwater eels,
                 but this approach may result in aberrant germ cell
                 development. To investigate the underlying causes,
                 levels of sex steroids (testosterone, T;
                 estradiol-17{\beta}, E2) and ovarian steroidogenic
                 enzyme mRNAs were compared between artificially
                 maturing Japanese eels and wild-caught, spontaneously
                 maturing New Zealand longfin eels. The latter were
                 employed as reference, as wild Japanese eels in
                 advanced stages of oogenesis are near-impossible to
                 catch. Serum T levels in artificially maturing Japanese
                 eel changed with stage in a pattern that was comparable
                 to that in longfin eels. Likewise, ovarian mRNA levels
                 of most steroidogenic enzyme genes were not
                 qualitatively dissimilar between both eel species when
                 taking developmental stage into account. However,
                 aromatase (cyp19a) mRNA levels, together with serum E2
                 levels, rapidly increased in artificially maturing
                 Japanese eels in mid-late stages of oogenesis
                 (gonadosomatic index, GSI = 13.8\%), whereas no such
                 increase was evident in longfin eels (GSI ~ 6.9\%). In
                 addition, sex steroid and target gene mRNA levels
                 fluctuated drastically with each hormone injection. We
                 contend that expression of most target genes, possibly
                 even that of cyp19a, during induced oogenesis could be
                 ``normal'', with the drastic fluctuations due most
                 likely to hormone delivery through repeated injections.
                 The effects of these fluctuations on gamete quality

  abstract =     "The regeneration of paired appendages in certain fish
                 and amphibian lineages is a well established and
                 extensively studied regenerative phenomenon. The
                 teleost fin is comprised of a proximal endoskeletal
                 part (considered homologous to the Tetrapod limb) and a
                 distal exoskeletal one, and these two parts form their
                 bony elements through different ossification processes.
                 In the past decade, a significant body of literature
                 has been generated about the biology of exoskeletal
                 regeneration in zebrafish. However, it is still not
                 clear if this knowledge can be applied to the
                 regeneration of endoskeletal parts. To address this
                 question, we decided to compare endo- and exoskeletal
                 regenerative capacity in zebrafish (\bioname{Danio
                 rerio}) and mudskippers (Periophthalmus barbarous). In
                 contrast to the reduced endoskeleton of zebrafish,
                 Periophthalmus has well developed pectoral fins with a
                 large and easily accessible endoskeleton. We performed
                 exo- and endoskeletal amputations in both species and
                 followed the regenerative processes. Unlike the almost
                 flawless exoskeletal regeneration observed in
                 zebrafish, regeneration following endoskeletal
                 amputation is often impaired in this species. This
                 difference is even more pronounced in Periophthalmus
                 where we could observe no regeneration in endoskeletal
                 structures. Therefore, regeneration is regulated
                 differentially in the exo- and endoskeleton of teleost
                 species.",

                 salmon (\bioname{Salmo salar}) numbers within that

                 depart from the Miramichi system during the striped

                 are the most threatened vertebrate group. Given their
                 considerable passion and knowledge, aquarium hobbyists
                 can play a vital role in their conservation. CARES is
                 made up of many organizations, whose purpose is to
                 encourage aquarium hobbyists to devote tank space to
                 the most endangered and overlooked freshwater fish to
                 ensure their survival. We found the CARES priority list
                 contains nearly six hundred species from twenty
                 families and two dozen extinct-in-the-wild species. The
                 major families were typically those with the largest
                 hobbyist affiliations such as killifish, livebearers,
                 and cichlids, the latter containing half of CARES
                 species. CARES included every IUCN threatened species
                 of Pseudomugilidae and Valenciidae, but only one
                 percent of threatened Characidae, Cobitidae, and
                 Gobiidae species. No Loricariidae in CARES were in the

                 the IUCN, including a third of extinct-in-the-wild
                 species classified as least concern by the IUCN. This
                 vast disconnect exemplifies the importance of future

                 cell types were also observed after few days in culture
                 indicating cell differentiation. Upon treatment with
                 all- trans retinoic acid, zebrafish blastema cells
                 differentiated into neuron-like and oligodendritic-like
                 cells. Immunocytochemistry data also revealed the
                 presence of mesenchymal and neuronal cells. The
                 availability of blastema cell cultures could contribute
                 to a better understanding of epimorphic regeneration by
                 providing a mean to investigate the mechanisms
                 underlying blastema cell differentiation. Furthermore,
                 this protocol is simple, rapid, and cost-efficient, and
                 can be virtually applied to the development of any fish

                 Atlantic coasts of the Americas. In the Mediterranean,
                 it appeared around 1949 and though that it is
                 established in East Mediterranean waters, relevant
                 studies are limited. The aim of the present study is to
                 report quantitative and qualitative data on the blue
                 crab's biology and ecology in its non-native range,
                 that are indispensable for management purposes.
                 Papapouli Lagoon is in Thermaikos Gulf and is
                 ecologically impacted by the blue crabs. Fyke nets with
                 a 20 mm mesh opening were soaked for 12 to 14 h during
                 each survey. Abiotic environmental parameters were
                 obtained. The length--weight relationships were
                 expressed by the equation W = aL b. The species'
                 ecological preferences at Papapouli Lagoon were
                 assessed with PERMANOVA analysis, using the abiotic
                 parameters as factors. Student's t -tests were used to
                 assess the differences between sexes. The sex ratio of
                 the blue crab's population was assessed by a Chi-square
                 ({\chi} 2) analysis. The sex ratio was found to be
                 1.28:1, in favour of males. The most dominant group
                 size of male blue crabs was the 61--70 mm of CL and
                 130--139 mm of CW. Also, the dominant size group of
                 female blue crabs was 60--69 mm of CL and 120--129 mm
                 CW. The maximum abundance of blue crabs was recorded at
                 a salinity range from 24{\SGMLpermil} to
                 25{\SGMLpermil} and the water temperature range was
                 from 26 to 28 {$^\circ $}C.",

                 coastlines due to more restrictive temperature
                 requirements for breeding and larval development. They

                 prevention, control, or eradication of invasive species
                 should always be up-to-date, as the failure to
                 recognize the problem, lack of adequate scientific
                 information, or long legal intervals required to
                 prepare the legislation may result in irreversible,

                 biology to predict dissemination and viability under

                 knowledge on the distribution, physiology, and behavior
                 of A. facetus, and applied the toolkits FISK v2 and
                 AS-ISK to this species to evaluate whether the species
                 should be classified as invasive in Portugal. Field
                 data show high abundance of the species in most streams
                 and dominance in specific hotspots. The scores reached

                 aquaculture. In this study, genetic estimates
                 associated with lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV)
                 disease susceptibility and growth were determined in
                 sea bream juveniles. Two fish batches (named batch 1
                 and batch 2) were built from mass spawning and reared
                 under industrial conditions until disease outbreak. At
                 the moment of the sampling (n = 500 specimens for each
                 batch), all animals had the typical LCDV lesions in the
                 skin. For phenotyping, animals were weighted and
                 photographed for image analysis (surface covered and
                 lesion intensity). LCDV DNA copies were quantified in
                 the liver by qPCR. Batch 1 had a higher surface covered
                 and lesion intensity than batch 2, and the body caudal
                 region was the lowest affected region in both batches.
                 The average LCDV DNA copies in liver were higher in the
                 batch 1 than batch 2, and they were positively
                 correlated with severity index (SI) categories (r 2 =
                 0.90--0.94). The total number of families evaluated
                 were 150 and 128 for batch 1 and batch 2, respectively,
                 with a high bias in offspring contribution by family
                 and broodstock. Heritabilities for weight and length
                 were 0.18 and 0.14 in batch 1 and 0.06 and 0.05 in
                 batch 2, respectively. Heritability for the number of
                 viral DNA copies was low ($<$0.08) in both batches.
                 Heritabilities for SI in binary scale were 0.32/0.33
                 and 0.21/0.24 (underlying liability/Bayesian approach)
                 for batch 1 and batch 2, respectively. Genetic
                 correlations were very high and positive when growth
                 traits (weight and length) or disease traits (LCDV DNA
                 copies and SI) were compared. In contrast, the genetic
                 correlations between growth and disease traits were
                 moderate--high and positive in the batch 1 but negative
                 in batch 2. These results indicate the genetic
                 selection for LCDV susceptibility and growth is
                 feasible in sea bream juveniles, although estimates are
                 highly dependent on the age. The information provided
                 is relevant to designing selective breeding programs in
                 sea bream.",

                 their physiology for more sustainable management of
                 fisheries. Here, we investigated the effects of warming
                 (OW; +4 {$^\circ $}C) and acidification (OA; {\Delta}pH
                 = 0.5) on the heart and oxygen consumption rates,
                 metabolic enzymatic machinery---namely citrate synthase
                 (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and
                 {\ss}-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), of seabream
                 (\bioname{Sparus aurata}) larvae (fifteen days after

                 significant increase with rising temperature, but
                 decreased with p CO 2. Results revealed a significant
                 increase of LDH activity with OW and a significant
                 decrease of the aerobic potential (CS and HOAD
                 activity) of larvae with OA. In contrast, under OA, the
                 activity levels of the enzyme LDH and the LDH:CS ratio
                 indicated an enhancement of anaerobic pathways.
                 Although such a short-term metabolic strategy may
                 eventually sustain the basic costs of maintenance, it
                 might not be adequate under the future chronic ocean
                 conditions. Given that the potential for adaptation to
                 new forthcoming conditions is yet experimentally
                 unaccounted for this species, future research is
                 essential to accurately predict the physiological

                 accurate genetic records, potentially leading to
                 unintended consequences for wild populations. We
                 analyzed the genetics of 459 wild and 701
                 hatchery-reared specimens from nine batches produced by
                 various hatcheries. Wild and hatchery-reared samples
                 could be considered two separate clades by using a set
                 of stable and informative microsatellite markers
                 including type I (from gene introns and 3{\prime}UTR)
                 and type II markers (randomly picked up from genome).
                 Type I microsatellite markers could more sensitively
                 reflect the loss of genetic diversity more than type II
                 markers in the domestication process. All specimens
                 were considered native by using mtDNA COI and
                 microsatellites. The genetic composition of the wild
                 population is relatively simple, and the estimated low
                 contribution rate of the hatchery stock (1.3--10.9\%;
                 6--50/459) indicated a weak but significant genetic
                 effect of stock enhancement. Therefore, establishing
                 standards for the stock enhancement of silver sea bream
                 for more effective supplementation of wild populations
                 is imperative.",

                 and caused a precipitous decrease in abundance of
                 native Yellowstone cutthroat trout
                 \bioname{Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri}. Suppression
                 efforts (primarily gillnetting) initiated in 1995 did
                 not curtail lake trout population growth or lakewide
                 expansion. An adaptive management strategy was
                 developed in 2010 that specified desired conditions
                 indicative of ecosystem recovery. Population modeling
                 was used to estimate effects of suppression efforts on
                 the lake trout and establish effort benchmarks to
                 achieve negative population growth ({\lambda} {$<$} 1).
                 Partnerships enhanced funding support, and a scientific
                 review panel provided guidance to increase suppression
                 gillnetting effort to $>$46,800 100-m net nights; this
                 effort level was achieved in 2012 and led to a
                 reduction in lake trout biomass. Total lake trout
                 biomass declined from 432,017 kg in 2012 to 196,675 kg
                 in 2019, primarily because of a 79\% reduction in
                 adults. Total abundance declined from 925,208 in 2012
                 to 673,983 in 2019 but was highly variable because of
                 recruitment of age-2 fish. Overall, 3.35 million lake
                 trout were killed by suppression efforts from 1995 to
                 2019. Cutthroat trout abundance remained below target
                 levels, but relative condition increased, large
                 individuals ($>$ 400 mm) became more abundant, and
                 individual weights doubled, probably because of reduced
                 density. Continued actions to suppress lake trout will
                 facilitate further recovery of the cutthroat trout
                 population and integrity of the Yellowstone Lake

  abstract =     "Invasive pest species are recognized as one of the
                 important drivers of reduced global biodiversity. In
                 Australia, the 267 invasive plant, animal and microbial
                 species, established since European colonization in the
                 1770s, have been unequivocally declared the most
                 important threat to species diversity in this country.
                 One invasive pest, the common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus
                 carpio}), has been targeted in an integrated pest
                 management plan that might include cyprinid herpesvirus
                 3 (CyHV-3) as a potential biocontrol agent. The
                 species-specificity of the released virus (and of field
                 variants that will inevitably arise) has been assessed,
                 and the virus judged to be safe. It has also been
                 hypothesised that, because the virulence of the CyHV-3
                 will likely decline following release, the virus should
                 be used strategically: initially, the aim would be to
                 markedly reduce numbers of carp in naive populations,
                 and then some other, as yet uncertain, complementary
                 broad-scale control measure would knock-down carp
                 numbers even further. Brief results are included from
                 recent studies on the modelling of release and spread
                 of the virus, the ecological and social concerns
                 associated with virus release, and the restoration
                 benefits that might be expected following carp control.
                 We conclude that, while further work is required (on
                 the virus, the target species, environmental issues,
                 and especially the identification of a suitable
                 broad-scale complementary control measure), optimism
                 must prevail in order to ensure an eventual solution to
                 this important environmental problem.",

                 salmonids and other native fish populations across the
                 region. Over the last decade, adaptive management of

                 and research to mitigate damages from pike where
                 feasible. Pike suppression efforts have been focused in
                 open drainages of the northern and western Cook Inlet
                 areas, and eradication efforts have been primarily
                 focused on the Kenai Peninsula and the municipality of
                 Anchorage. Between 2010 and 2020, almost 40,000 pike

                 causes problems in Atlantic salmon (\bioname{Salmo
                 salar}) aquaculture in the Northern Hemisphere, because
                 infestations can result in both a loss of production
                 and in fish mortality. Several types of treatment have
                 been used to control louse infestations, but these have
                 seen varying success. The aim of this review is to
                 examine the efficacy and safety of commonly used
                 treatments (chemical, biological, mechanical, and
                 preventive measures) as documented in peer-reviewed
                 publications. Efficacy is assessed in relation to a
                 reduction in numbers of lice, and safety is assessed as
                 a lack of negative treatment-associated effects on fish
                 health and welfare (Atlantic salmon and/or cleaner
                 fish). Most chemical treatments showed decreasing
                 efficacy over time, together with the use of increasing
                 concentrations as a result of the development of
                 resistance to the treatments by lice. The need for a
                 restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment
                 efficacy has been emphasized. The use of cleaner fish
                 was suggested to be effective, with few or no negative
                 effects towards Atlantic salmon. The use of cleaner
                 fish would be preferable to chemical treatment if the
                 farmed fish health and welfare criteria are met. At
                 present, the number of peer-reviewed publications
                 relating to other forms of treatment and prevention are

                 sound way in fishponds by applying integrated
                 agriculture and aquaculture systems (IAA). This kind of
                 waste recycling can help to protect the environment
                 from pollution and improve fishpond yields.
                 Additionally, IAA provides an opportunity for
                 diversification of the output from two or more existing
                 subsystems leading to higher overall farm economic

                 of amaranth wastes (AW) as a dietary ingredient for
                 tilapia in a tilapia-amaranths integrated system (ITA).
                 An experimental diet (AD) contained 10\% (based on the
                 control diet, CD) inclusion of AW collected from a
                 nearby vegetable market. The experiments included
                 triplicate treatments with; (i) fish fed on AD, where
                 the pond water was used for irrigating the amaranth
                 plants (IAA-fish), and (ii) fish fed on CD, where no

                 (non-IAA fish). 90 days after fish stocking, eighteen 4
                 m 2 amaranth plots were prepared and treated with (i)
                 tap water without fertilization (control amaranths),

                 are spreading throughout the Mississippi River basin.
                 To explore the efficacy of a consumer-based market
                 (i.e., invasivorism) to manage them, we developed a
                 conceptual model and evaluated three harvest
                 approaches---direct contracted removal, volume-based
                 incentives (``fisher-side'' control), and set-quota
                 harvest (``market-side'' control). We quantified the
                 efficacy of these approaches and potential population
                 impact in the Illinois River. Contracted removal was
                 effective for suppressing small populations at the edge
                 of the range but cannot support a market.
                 ``Fisher-side'' removals totaled 225,372 kg in one
                 year. However, participation was low, perhaps due to
                 reporting requirements for fishers. The
                 ``market-side'', set-quota approach removed $>$1.3
                 million kg of bigheaded carp in less than 6 months.
                 Larger, older fish were disproportionately harvested,
                 which may hinder the ability to suppress population
                 growth. Total density declined in one river reach, and
                 harvest may reduce upstream movement toward the
                 invasion fronts. With sufficient market demand, harvest
                 may control bigheaded carp. However, lack of processing
                 infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks could
                 constrain harvest, particularly at low commodity
                 prices. Given the geographical scale of this invasion
                 and complicated harvest logistics, concerns about
                 economic dependence on invasivorism that encourage
                 stock enhancement are likely unmerited.",

                 important data for managers seeking to control invasive
                 grass carp populations. Ichthyoplankton tows for grass
                 carp eggs and larvae can be used to detect spawning
                 events; however, these samples can be highly
                 debris-laden, and are expensive and laborious to
                 process. An alternative method, environmental DNA
                 (eDNA) technology, has proven effective in determining
                 the presence of aquatic species. The objectives of this
                 project were to assess the use of eDNA collections and
                 quantitative eDNA analysis to assess the potential
                 spawning of grass carp in five reservoir tributaries,
                 and to compare those results to the more traditional
                 method of ichthyoplankton tows. Grass carp eDNA was
                 detected in 56\% of sampling occasions and was detected
                 in all five rivers. Concentrations of grass carp eDNA
                 were orders of magnitude higher in June, corresponding
                 to elevated discharge and egg presence. Grass carp
                 environmental DNA flux (copies/h) was lower when no
                 eggs were present and was higher when velocities and
                 discharge increased and eggs were present. There was a
                 positive relationship between grass carp eDNA flux and
                 egg flux. Our results support the further development
                 of eDNA analysis as a method to detect the spawning
                 events of grass carp or other rheophilic spawners.",

  abstract =     "Alterations in gonad morphology are widespread in wild
                 fish populations. Whitefish (Coregonus spp.) from Lake
                 Thun, Switzerland, display a high prevalence of
                 macroscopical gonad malformations including fusions to
                 the musculature, segmented gonads and intersex
                 condition. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
                 whether the gonad morphological changes in Lake Thun
                 whitefish are caused by genetic factors, environmental
                 factors (water, diet) or ``gene $ \times $
                 environment'' interaction. We performed two independent
                 experiments of a three-year duration in which we reared
                 whitefish from fertilization until adulthood and tested
                 the possible causative factors using a matrix design:
                 (i) genetics---comparing the prevalence of gonad
                 malformations in whitefish of different genetic origin
                 reared under identical environmental conditions (same
                 diet, same water, same experimental facility); (ii)
                 environment---comparing the prevalence of gonad
                 malformations in whitefish of the same genetic origin
                 reared in different water sources and/or fed with
                 different diets; and (iii) gene-environment
                 interaction---comparing the prevalence of gonad
                 morphological alterations in relation to the
                 combinations of genetics and environmental factors. Two
                 diets were used for the rearing experiments: either
                 zooplankton collected in Lake Thun which represents the
                 natural diet of whitefish, or an artificial dry food
                 which was used as control. The key finding of this
                 study is that the inducing factor of the gonad
                 malformations is contained in the zooplankton of Lake
                 Thun. Fish fed with this diet developed a significantly
                 higher prevalence of malformations than fish from any
                 other treatment, irrespective of the genetic origin
                 and/or the water source. This result could be repeated
                 in the two independent experiments. Importantly, the
                 prevalence values observed in the experimental fish fed
                 with Lake Thun zooplankton were similar to the
                 prevalence values recorded in free-ranging whitefish in
                 the lake. The findings of this study advance the
                 understanding of the causes of gonad morphological
                 alterations in wild fish populations.",

  abstract =     "Invasive species are a threat to biodiversity in
                 freshwater. Removing an aquatic invasive species
                 following arrival is almost impossible, and preventing
                 introduction is a more viable management option.
                 Bigheaded carp are an invasive fish spreading
                 throughout the Midwestern {United States} and are
                 threatening to enter the Great Lakes. This review
                 outlines the development of carbon dioxide gas (CO 2)
                 as a non-physical barrier that can be used to deter the
                 movement of fish and prevent further spread. Carbon
                 dioxide gas could be used as a deterrent either to
                 cause avoidance (i.e., fish swim away from zones of
                 high CO 2), or by inducing equilibrium loss due to the
                 anesthetic properties of CO 2 (i.e., tolerance). The
                 development of CO 2 as a fish deterrent started with
                 controlled laboratory experiments demonstrating stress
                 and avoidance, and then progressed to larger field
                 applications demonstrating avoidance at scales that
                 approach real-world scenarios. In addition, factors
                 that influence the effectiveness of CO 2 as a fish
                 barrier are discussed, outlining conditions that could
                 make CO 2 less effective in the field; these factors
                 that influence efficacy would be of interest to
                 managers using CO 2 to target other fish species, or
                 those using other non-physical barriers for fish.",

  abstract =     "Striped bass is the subject of important commercial
                 and sport fisheries in North America. The Roanoke River
                 drainage---especially Smith Mountain Lake, Leesville
                 Lake, and Kerr Reservoir---has popular recreational
                 striped bass fisheries. After construction of five
                 hydroelectric dams, populations became landlocked,
                 declined, and have been supplemented by stocking. A key
                 basis for responsibly augmenting populations is to
                 characterize genetic variation and incorporate the
                 findings into responsible hatchery and stocking
                 practices. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite DNA
                 loci was evaluated among 837 striped bass representing
                 16 collections across the native range; populations
                 from rivers in South Carolina, North Carolina,
                 Chesapeake Bay, and Hudson River were screened to
                 provide context for assessing genetic structure within
                 the Roanoke system. Analysis of population genetic
                 differentiation showed landlocked Roanoke River striped
                 bass to be distinctive. Subject to genetic isolation,
                 high M ratios, and relatively low N e estimates suggest
                 loss of genetic variation, and relatedness analysis
                 showed heightened frequencies of related individuals.
                 These insights into population genetics, demographics,
                 and existing guidelines for broodstock acquisition and
                 mating designs can inform genetically cognizant
                 hatchery management and stocking for striped bass in
                 the Roanoke River drainage. In particular, we recommend
                 the use of larger numbers of breeders and factorial
                 mating designs to increase the genetic diversity of
                 propagated striped bass stocked within the Roanoke
                 River drainage.",

                 toxicity assessment. However, current guidelines for
                 toxicity assessment focus on teratogenicity and
                 mortality. From an ecotoxicological point of view,
                 however, these endpoints may not reflect the ``full
                 picture'' of possible deleterious effects that can
                 nonetheless result in decreased fitness and/or
                 inability to adapt to a changing environment, affecting
                 whole populations. Therefore, assessing sublethal
                 effects add relevant data covering different aspects of
                 toxicity at different levels of analysis. The impacts
                 of toxicants on neurobehavioral function have the
                 potential to affect many different life-history traits,
                 and are easier to assess in the laboratory than in the
                 wild. We propose that carefully-controlled laboratory
                 experiments on different behavioral domains---including
                 anxiety, aggression, and exploration---can increase our
                 understanding of the ecotoxicological impacts of
                 contaminants, since these domains are related to traits
                 such as defense, sociality, and reproduction, directly
                 impacting life-history traits. The effects of selected
                 contaminants on these tests are reviewed, focusing on
                 larval and adult zebrafish, showing that these
                 behavioral domains are highly sensitive to small
                 concentrations of these substances. These strategies

  abstract =     "Single-cell ingredients (SCI) are a relatively broad
                 class of materials that encompasses bacterial, fungal
                 (yeast), microalgal-derived products or the combination
                 of all three microbial groups into microbial bioflocs
                 and aggregates. In this review we focus on those dried
                 and processed single-cell organisms used as potential
                 ingredients for aqua-feeds where the microorganisms are
                 considered non-viable and are used primarily to provide
                 protein, lipids or specific nutritional components.
                 Among the SCI, there is a generalised dichotomy in
                 terms of their use as either single-cell protein (SCP)
                 resources or single-cell oil (SCO) resources, with SCO
                 products being those oleaginous products containing 200
                 g/kg or more of lipids, whereas those products
                 considered as SCP resources tend to contain more than
                 300 g/kg of protein (on a dry basis). Both SCP and SCO
                 are now widely being used as protein/amino acid
                 sources, omega-3 sources and sources of bioactive
                 molecules in the diets of several species, with the
                 current range of both these ingredient groups being
                 considerable and growing. However, the different array
                 of products becoming available in the market, how they
                 are produced and processed has also resulted in
                 different nutritional qualities in those products. In
                 assessing this variation among the products and the
                 application of the various types of SCI, we have taken
                 the approach of evaluating their use against a set of
                 standardised evaluation criteria based around key
                 nutritional response parameters and how these criteria
                 have been applied against salmonids, shrimp, tilapia

                 awareness of feed-quality issues and firmly establish
                 and expand the use of formulated feed. According to the
                 results, the M.P group was higher in weight gain, feed
                 efficiency ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and
                 specific growth rate and lower in mortality rate than
                 the E.P group. All cases of mortality were caused by
                 six kinds of disease, four of which (Vibrio sp.,
                 Edwardsiella sp., Streptococcus sp., and
                 Scuticociliates) were common to the two groups, whereas
                 Lymphocystis arose only in the M.P group and abdominal
                 inflation only in the E.P group at both farms. As for
                 mortality in the present experiment, the numbers were
                 1047 at Da-Hae farm and 1167 at Global farm, with more
                 fish dying in the E.P tanks than in the M.P tanks. By
                 multiplying the number of deaths by selling price, the
                 economic losses were \$9650 and \$10,756, respectively.
                 Therefore, it should be considered an urgent priority

                 improved digestion and absorption rate and also to

                 was drawn upon from the second experiment. All
                 experiments were conducted in 20 L containers
                 containing 20 hph P. hypophthalmus larvae at a density
                 of 10 ind/L and fed rotifers (Brachionus angularis) for
                 3 days and then water fleas (\bioname{Moina macrocopa})
                 for 7 days. The first experiment demonstrated that
                 larvae initially fed at 30 hph exhibited a
                 significantly higher survival rate (24\%) than larvae
                 initially fed at 36, 42, and 48 hph (19\%, 16\%, and
                 16\%), respectively. The second experiment demonstrated
                 that larvae fed at 8 and 11 ind/mL densities exhibited
                 significantly higher survival rates (32\% and 32\%)
                 than larvae fed at 3 and 5 ind/mL densities (13\% and
                 23\%), respectively. The third experiment demonstrated
                 that the highest survival rate (66\%) was obtained when
                 larvae were fed 6 times per day. These results provide
                 valuable insights regarding the optimal live feed
                 regime for better growth and survival of P.

  abstract =     "The common carp has been highly problematic in North
                 American ecosystems since its introduction over a
                 century ago. In many watersheds, its abundance appears
                 to be driven by source-sink dynamics in which carp
                 reproduce successfully in peripheral ponds that lack
                 egg/larva micro-predators which then serve as sources
                 of recruits for deeper lakes. This manuscript describes
                 how carp were sustainably reduced in two chains of
                 lakes by disrupting source-sink dynamics in three
                 steps. First, we ascertained whether lakes had
                 problematic densities of carp that could be explained
                 by source-sink dynamics. Second, ways to control
                 recruitment were developed and implemented including:
                 (i) aerating source ponds to reduce hypoxia and
                 increase micro-predator abundance, (ii) blocking carp
                 migration, and (iii) locating and removing adults from
                 sinks using targeted netting guided by Judas fish.
                 Third, we monitored and adapted. Using this strategy,
                 the density of carp in 3 lakes in one chain was reduced
                 from 177 kg/ha to ~100 kg/ha in 3 years and held
                 constant for a decade. Similarly, adult density was
                 reduced from 300 kg carp/ha in 2 lakes in the other
                 chain to 25 kg/ha. Once carp densities were low,
                 aluminum sulfate treatments became reasonable and once
                 conducted, water quality improved.",

                 high regeneration capacity that interacts with the
                 surrounding environment and provides protection.
                 Functional importance, high complexity and activity
                 make skin an attractive tissue for studying the effects
                 of environmental challenges and chemical stressors in
                 fish. The aim of this work was to characterize skin
                 from polar cod (\bioname{Boreogadus saida}) and
                 Atlantic cod (\bioname{Gadus morhua}), and to test cod
                 skin as an in vitro model in exposure studies. Both
                 species have similar skin structures including
                 epidermis, mucous cells, club cells and scales.
                 However, microarchitectural differences were detected;
                 Atlantic cod has a smooth epidermal surface and
                 overlapping scales, whereas polar cod has a folded
                 outer surface and discontinuous scales. Genome-wide
                 microarray found 6.5k genes with expression
                 differences, which suggested more active turnover of
                 proteins, proliferation and motility of cells in skin
                 of polar cod. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used to
                 examine skin responses. Transcriptome response was
                 stronger in the skin of polar cod, with 155
                 differentially expressed genes. The skin from Atlantic
                 cod was further used to develop a cell culture. H 2 O 2
                 decreased the cell migration rate in a dose-dependent
                 manner, which could indicate reduced skin healing
                 capacity. The results revealed novel skin structures
                 and confirmed that the skin from cod is a promising
                 tissue for evaluation of stressors.",

                 to North America from Europe in the mid-1980s and based
                 on similar diets and habit use may compete with yellow
                 perch (\bioname{Perca flavescens}). To examine
                 competitive interactions between invasive ruffe and
                 native yellow perch, individually marked perch and
                 ruffe were placed in mesocosms in a small lake.
                 Mesocosms allowed fish to interact and feed on the
                 natural prey populations enclosed. In the first
                 experiment, four treatments were assessed: 28 perch, 14
                 perch + 14 ruffe, 14 perch, and 7 perch + 7 ruffe.
                 Yellow perch growth was significantly lower in the
                 presence of ruffe (ANOVA, p = 0.005) than in treatments
                 containing only perch. In a second experiment, an
                 increasing density of one species was superimposed upon
                 a constant density of the other in parallel treatment
                 series. Growth rates of both ruffe and perch declined
                 when ruffe density was increased (t test, p = 0.006).
                 However, neither ruffe nor perch growth was affected by
                 increasing perch density. Total stomach content mass of
                 perch was significantly decreased by ruffe in both
                 years (p {$<$} 0.02), but no effects of ruffe on the
                 composition of perch diets were observed. Ruffe growth
                 and food consumption was greater than that of perch for
                 both experiments. Ruffe can outcompete yellow perch
                 when both species depend on a limited benthic food
                 resource. Thus there is reason for concern for the
                 ecological effects of ruffe if they expand their range
                 into {Lake Erie} or North American inland lakes that
                 contain yellow perch.",

                 marine shrimp (MSH), cattle blood (CB), duckweed (DW)
                 and fish frames (FF). The AD (\%) of dry matter (DM),
                 organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) was
                 unaffected (p $>$ 0.782--0.901) by the faeces
                 collection method (i.e., siphoning or stripping), with

                 was high ($>$76\%), but with a low value (46\%) for DW.
                 The AD (\%) of GE was closely correlated (r = 0.96)
                 with the AD of OM. In conclusion, FSH, MSH, CB, FF, BSY

  abstract =     "Stingrays play a key role in the regulation of
                 nearshore ecosystems. However, their movement ecology
                 in high-energy surf areas remains largely unknown due
                 to the notorious difficulties in conducting research in
                 these environments. Using a blimp as an aerial platform
                 for video surveillance, we overcame some of the
                 limitations of other tracking methods, such as the use
                 of tags and drones. This novel technology offered
                 near-continuous coverage to characterise the fine-scale
                 movements of stingrays in a surf area in Kiama,
                 Australia, without any invasive procedures. A total of
                 98 stingray tracks were recorded, providing 6 h 27 min
                 of movement paths. The tracking data suggest that
                 stingrays may use a depth gradient located in the
                 sandflat area of the bay for orientating their
                 movements and transiting between locations within their
                 home range. Our research also indicates that stingray
                 behaviour was influenced by diel periods and tidal
                 states. We observed a higher stingray occurrence during
                 the afternoon, potentially related to foraging and
                 anti-predatory strategies. We also saw a reduced route
                 fidelity during low tide, when the bathymetric
                 reference was less accessible due to stranding risk.
                 Considering the increasing threat of anthropogenic
                 development to nearshore coastal environments, the
                 identification of these patterns can better inform the
                 management and mitigation of threats.",

                 compared the muscle quality of grass carp
                 (\bioname{Ctenopharyngodon idellus}) cultured at
                 salinities of 0\permille, 3\permille, and 6\permille
                 (GC0, GC3, GC6). There was no significant difference in
                 crude protein and crude fat content of muscle between
                 GC0 and GC3. Crude fat was significantly lower in GC6
                 compared to the other groups. GC3 and GC6 had higher
                 hydroxyproline content, which suggested that these
                 groups had higher collagen content. GC3 and GC6 had
                 higher contents of free amino acids and umami amino
                 acids than GC0, but there was no significant difference

                 salinity increased, the diameter of muscle fibers
                 decreased and the sarcolemma showed a thickening trend.
                 These results suggest that a slight increase in

  abstract =     "Common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus carpio}, L. 1758) are
                 the most abundant pest fish species in Australia,
                 detrimental to ecosystem integrity and values, and in
                 need of suitable management solutions. In January 1995,
                 this destructive pest was discovered in two large,
                 connected Tasmanian lakes --- Lakes Crescent (23 km 2)
                 and Sorell (54 km 2). After an initial assessment, carp
                 were immediately contained to these waters using
                 screens to prevent their escape down-stream, followed
                 by swift legislation to enforce closure of the lakes to
                 the public. Assessment and evaluation of carp numbers
                 occurred throughout the eradication program, with
                 effort focused on Lake Crescent. Beginning with
                 undirected removal, techniques progressively evolved to
                 more sophisticated targeted removal with assistance
                 from biotelemetry, in conjunction with gill netting and
                 electro-fishing. Real-time population estimates and in
                 situ observations resulted in a detailed cumulative
                 understanding of carp population dynamics, behaviour
                 and seasonal habitat choice. This allowed strategic
                 deployment of fences to block access to marshes, and
                 the installation of steel traps within the fences.
                 These gears specifically prevented spawning
                 opportunities, while concurrently capturing mature
                 fish. Following 12 years of adaptive and integrated
                 effort, 7797 carp (fry, juvenile and adult) were
                 captured from Lake Crescent, with the last carp being
                 caught in December 2007. The subsequent 14 years of
                 monitoring has not resulted in the capture of any carp,
                 confirming the successful eradication of carp from Lake
                 Crescent. These management practices have been
                 successfully replicated in the larger Lake Sorell,
                 where 41,499 carp (fry, juvenile and adult) have been
                 removed. It is now estimated that there are few, if any
                 carp remaining. Collectively, the techniques and
                 strategies described here were reliable, and can be
                 applied as a model to control or eradicate pest
                 populations of carp in freshwater lakes elsewhere.",

                 of potential ways through which they may interact, yet
                 there is often a strong focus on studies of single
                 species without considering these interactions. For
                 example, many studies of forestry--stream interactions
                 in the Pacific Northwest have focused solely on the

  abstract =     "When multiple species of fish coexist there are a host
                 of potential ways through which they may interact, yet
                 there is often a strong focus on studies of single
                 species without considering these interactions. For
                 example, many studies of forestry--stream interactions
                 in the Pacific Northwest have focused solely on the
                 most prevalent species: Coastal cutthroat trout. To
                 examine the potential for interactions of other fishes
                 with coastal cutthroat trout, we conducted an analysis
                 of 281 sites in low order streams located on
                 Washington's Olympic Peninsula and along the central
                 Oregon coast. Coastal cutthroat trout and juvenile coho
                 salmon were the most commonly found salmonid species
                 within these streams and exhibited positive
                 associations with each other for both presence and
                 density. Steelhead were negatively associated with the
                 presence of coastal cutthroat trout as well as with
                 coho salmon and sculpins (Cottidae). Coastal cutthroat
                 trout most frequently shared streams with juvenile coho
                 salmon. For densities of these co-occurring species,
                 associations between these two species were relatively

                 has been a necessary component of its fishery
                 restoration and recovery goals for 30 years. While
                 adopting the approach of the larger and established sea
                 lamprey control program of the Laurentian Great Lakes,
                 local differences emerged that shifted management focus
                 and effort as the program evolved. Increased investment
                 in lamprey assessment and monitoring revealed
                 under-estimations of population density and
                 distribution in the basin, where insufficient control
                 efforts went unnoticed. As control efforts improved in
                 response to a better understanding of the population,
                 the effects of lamprey on the fishery lessened. A
                 long-term evaluation of fishery responses when lamprey
                 control was started, interrupted, delayed, and enhanced
                 provided evidence of a recurring relationship between
                 the level of control effort applied and the measured
                 suppression of the parasitic sea lamprey population.
                 Changes in levels of control efforts over time showed
                 repeatedly that measurable suppression of the parasitic
                 population required effective control of 80\% of the
                 known larval population. Understanding the importance
                 of assessment and monitoring and the relationship
                 between control effort and population suppression has
                 led to recognition that a comprehensive, not
                 incremental, approach is needed to achieve effective
                 control of sea lamprey in Lake Champlain.",

                 growth rates and asymptotic size) that are used in the
                 management of fisheries stocks. Traditionally in
                 fisheries science, it was common to fit one growth
                 model---the von Bertalanffy growth model---to
                 size-at-age data. However, in recent years, fisheries
                 science has seen an increase in the number of growth
                 models available and the evaluation of multiple growth
                 models for a given species or study. We reviewed n =
                 196 peer-reviewed age and growth studies and n = 50
                 NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
                 regional stock assessments to examine trends in the use
                 of growth models and model selection in fisheries over
                 time. Our results indicate that the total number of age
                 and growth studies increased annually since 1988 with a
                 slight proportional increase in the use of multi-model
                 frameworks. Information theoretic approaches are
                 replacing goodness-of-fit and a priori model selection
                 in fisheries studies; however, this trend is not
                 reflected in NOAA stock assessments, which almost
                 exclusively rely on the von Bertalanffy growth model.
                 Covariates such as system (e.g., marine or fresh),
                 location of study, diet, family, maximum age, and range
                 of age data used in model fitting did not contribute to
                 which model was ultimately the best fitting, suggesting
                 that there are no large-scale patterns of specific
                 growth models being applied to species with common life
                 histories or other attributes. Given the importance and
                 ubiquity of growth modeling to fisheries science, a
                 historical and contemporary understanding of the
                 practice is critical to evaluate improvements that have

                 \bioname{Alosa alosa} from the Minho River. This basin

                 critically endangered anadromous fish species. Besides
                 assessing the importance of the environmental drivers
                 of fish capture data (temperature, salinity, upwelling,

                 from 1914 to 2017, and the latter recording a

                 correlations were detected between fishing data and
                 environmental variables, some of the identified
                 breakpoints in the time series data matched the dates

                 historical activities associated with mining might
                 explain the notable changes detected in the trends,

  abstract =     "In fishes, it is necessary to select a salinity
                 environment suitable for survival. However, little is
                 known about the mechanisms regarding detection and
                 selection of salinity environments in fish. This study
                 involved the establishment of a simple aquarium system
                 in which fish can swim between freshwater (FW) and
                 seawater (SW) in a single tank. In this tank, the lower
                 level contained SW, the upper level contained FW, and
                 the FW and SW levels were clearly separated as
                 different salinity areas. Behavioral experiments of
                 salinity environment selection using this simplified
                 system to evaluate salinity preference showed that
                 FW-acclimated medakas preferred FW to SW. In contrast,
                 SW-acclimated medakas preferred SW to FW. These results
                 indicate that euryhaline medakas prefer the saline
                 habitats to which they are acclimated, when able to
                 select the salinity environment. We identified the
                 taste receptor type-2 and polycystic kidney disease
                 2-like 1 genes as possibly related to high-salinity
                 taste in medaka. The expression of these genes
                 increased at certain time points after SW challenges.
                 In this study, we established an aquarium system to
                 facilitate a simple experiment for salinity preference.
                 Our results suggest that the medaka is good model for
                 research related to seawater environment selection in
                 fish.",

                 molecular chaperone that is indispensable for molecular
                 maturation of collagen. In this study, hsp47 and
                 hsp47-like cDNAs were cloned and characterized in grass
                 carp (\bioname{Ctenopharyngodon idella}). The cDNAs
                 were 1212 and 1218 base pairs long, respectively, and
                 included an open reading frame encoding 403 and 405
                 amino acids. The molecular phylogeny based on the
                 deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the correct
                 sequences of the hsp47 and hsp47-like cDNA were
                 obtained and the deduced proteins clustered distinctly
                 into teleost clades. Primary structure analysis and
                 characterization of Hsp47 and Hsp47-like shared the
                 basic structure and biofunctions of Hsp47 in
                 vertebrates. The spatial pattern of gene expression
                 revealed that hsp47 and hsp47-like were relatively
                 ubiquitous in different tissues and highly expressed in
                 heart and skin. The expression levels of hsp47 and
                 hsp47-like and type I collagen mRNAs varied similarly
                 in different tissues. Type I collagen content increased
                 significantly with the increase of water velocity in
                 the muscle of grass carp in response to aerobic
                 exercise. Among the gene expression changes of hsp47,
                 hsp47-like, col1a1 and col1a2 in muscle that occurred
                 in response to aerobic exercise, the change of type I
                 collagen was most strongly correlated with hsp47
                 expression. Additionally, col1a1 showed the highest
                 correlation with hsp47-like and col1a2 showed the
                 highest correlation with hsp47. These findings suggest
                 that grass carp Hsp47 and Hsp47-like are closely
                 related to type I collagen synthesis. This study
                 firstly suggests fish aerobic exercise can improve type

                 Palabuhanratu Bay is dominated by \bioname{Panulirus
                 homarus} (green sand lobster), \bioname{Panulirus

                 spatial model using satellite-derived data to predict
                 potential lobster harvest grounds in Palabuhanratu Bay.
                 The Earth observational satellite data used were

                 groups showed significantly inhibited delayed
                 convulsion and ATP consumption. This suggests that
                 delayed convulsion is the main ATP-consuming response.
                 Our findings suggest that delayed clonic convulsion in
                 red seabreams is associated with the rapid decrease in
                 spinal cord NE levels, which triggered the rebound
                 motor neuron hyperactivity.",

                 Mississippi River by passing through its locks-and-dams
                 (LDs). Although these structures already impede fish
                 passage, this role could be greatly enhanced by
                 modifying how their spillway gates operate, adding
                 deterrent systems to their locks, and removing carp.
                 This study examined this possibility using numeric
                 modeling and empirical data, which evaluated all three
                 options on an annual basis in both single LDs and pairs
                 under different river flow conditions. Over 100
                 scenarios were modeled. While all three approaches
                 showed promise, ranging from 8\% to 73\% reductions in
                 how many carp pass a single LD, when employed together
                 at pairs of LDs, upstream movement rates of invasive
                 carp could be reduced 98--99\% from current levels.
                 Although modifying spillway gate operation is the least
                 expensive option, its efficacy drops at high flows, so
                 lock deterrents and/or removal using fishing/trapping
                 are required to move towards complete blockage.
                 Improved deterrent efficacy could also offset the need
                 for more efficient removal. This model could help
                 prioritize research and management actions for
                 containing carp.",

                 data processing methods and text mining technology to

                 important findings: (1) After three adjustments and
                 developments, the fishery insurance policy has grown in
                 terms of initial attention, changes, and development
                 and gradually matured. (2) A gap exists between the
                 content of the fishing insurance policy text and the
                 actual demand. The scoring results of the policy
                 samples are concentrated in the acceptable range, the
                 policy effects are not satisfactory, and the
                 formulation of fishery insurance policies has weak
                 links that need to be improved. (3) The consistency and
                 effectiveness of fishery insurance policies have
                 developed simultaneously with fishery insurance
                 research, and the practical effects of high-quality
                 fishery insurance policies are conducive to the
                 development of theoretical research. (4) The policy
                 text of fishery insurance has major problems, such as
                 missing joint force of issuing institutions, low
                 professionalism of the text, inadequate subdivision
                 guidance of fishery insurance, weak social
                 effectiveness, high dependence on financial subsidies,
                 lack of incentive sustainability and corresponding laws
                 and regulations and reduction in policy feasibility
                 among others. Considering the above issues, this paper
                 puts forward relevant policy optimization paths and

                 widespread. Many stakeholders believe that fishery
                 subsidies play an important role in ensuring the
                 livelihood of fishermen. At the same time, fishery
                 subsidies pose a threat to the stock of fishery
                 resources and affect the sustainable development of
                 fisheries. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces,
                 municipalities, and autonomous regions in China from
                 2007 to 2017, the article empirically examines the
                 influence of fishery subsidies on fishing. The results
                 of the study show that China\prime s fishery subsidies
                 are negatively correlated with fishing. On average, for
                 each 1\% increase in fishery subsidies, fishing will
                 decrease by 2.9\%. That is to say, in general, fishery
                 subsidies are conducive to the sustainable development
                 of fisheries. The results of heterogeneity analysis
                 based on geographic location and economic development

                 the prediction accuracy of LSTM-NN (with a mean value

                 search for alternative protein sources is a continuous
                 process. The present feeding trial was conducted to
                 evaluate the effects of replacing fishmeal with
                 zooplankton biomass meal (ZBM) on the growth
                 performance, nutrient utilization, intestine, and liver

                 cephalus} (initial weight of 0.10 \pm 0.01 g). Five
                 isoproteic (35\% crude protein) and isolipidic (8\%
                 crude lipid) diets were formulated as the control diet
                 (Z 0) and the other four diets (Z 25, Z 50, Z 75, and Z
                 100), where 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\% of fishmeal was
                 replaced by ZBM, respectively. After 60 days of
                 feeding, the final weight, weight gain, and daily
                 growth index of the grey mullet fed the Z 100 diet were
                 higher than those fed the control diet (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 In addition, the better values of feed conversion
                 ratio, protein efficiency ratio and lipid efficiency
                 ratio were recorded in the fish fed with the Z 100
                 diet. Additionally, the intestinal villus length,
                 crypts depth, and muscle thickness were significantly
                 improved with ZBM inclusion (p {$<$} 0.05). Meanwhile,
                 there were no histopathological changes observed on the
                 liver when compared with the control group. From the
                 economic point of view, dietary substitution of
                 fishmeal by ZBM (Z 100) reduced the cost of diet
                 formulation by 18\% and the price per kg weight gain by
                 about 40\%. Overall, according to the findings of this

                 bleaching events in shallow waters triggered by thermal
                 anomalies and marine heatwaves linked to climate
                 change, a trend that is replicated worldwide. As sea
                 surface thermal anomalies are assumed to lessen with
                 depth, mesophotic deep reefs have been hypothesized to
                 act as refuges from anthropogenic and natural
                 disturbances, the \lq deep reef refugia hypothesis'
                 (DRRH). However, evidence supporting the DRRH is either
                 inconclusive or conflicting. We address this by
                 investigating four assumptions of the DRRH focusing on
                 the symbiotic association between anemones and
                 anemonefish. First, we compare long-term temperature
                 conditions between shallow (8 m) and mesophotic sites
                 (50 m) on the island of Moorea from 2011--2020. Second,
                 we compare the densities of the orange-fin anemonefish,
                 \bioname{Amphiprion chrysopterus} between shallow and
                 mesophotic (down to 60 m) reefs across three
                 archipelagos in French Polynesia. Finally, we compare
                 the percentage of anemone bleaching, as well as
                 anemonefish reproduction, between shallow and
                 mesophotic reefs. We found that the water column was
                 well mixed in the cooler austral winter months with
                 only a 0.19 \degree C difference in temperature between
                 depths, but in the warmer summer months mixing was
                 reduced resulting in a 0.71--1.03 \degree C temperature
                 difference. However, during thermal anomalies, despite
                 a time lag in warm surface waters reaching mesophotic
                 reefs, there was ultimately a 1.0 \degree C increase in
                 water temperature at both 8 and 50 m, pushing
                 temperatures over bleaching thresholds at both depths.
                 As such, anemone bleaching was observed in mesophotic
                 reefs during these thermal anomalies, but was buffered
                 compared to the percentage of bleaching in shallower
                 waters, which was nearly five times greater. Our
                 large-scale sampling across French Polynesia found
                 orange-fin anemonefish, A. chrysopterus, in mesophotic
                 zones in two high islands and one atoll across two
                 archipelagos, extending its bathymetric limit to 60 m;
                 however, orange-fin anemonefish densities were either
                 similar to, or 25--92 times lower than in shallower
                 zones. Three spawning events were observed at 50 m,
                 which occurred at a similar frequency to spawning on
                 shallower reefs at the same date. Our findings of
                 thermal anomalies and bleaching in mesophotic reefs,
                 coupled with mainly lower densities of anemonefish in
                 mesophotic populations, suggest that mesophotic reefs
                 show only a limited ability to provide refugia from
                 anthropogenic and natural disturbances.",

                 research; however, there are few reports on SNPs
                 related to the growth of \bioname{Penaeus vannamei}.
                 The purpose of this study was to call SNPs from
                 rapid-growing (RG) and slow-growing (SG) individuals'
                 transcriptomes and use DNA pool sequencing to assess
                 the reliability of SNPs. Two parameters were applied to
                 detect SNPs. One parameter was the p -values generated
                 using Fisher's exact test, which were used to calculate
                 the significance of allele frequency differences
                 between RG and SG. The other one was the AFI (minor
                 allele frequency imbalance), which was defined to
                 highlight the fold changes in MAF (minor allele
                 frequency) values between RG and SG. There were 216,015
                 hypothetical SNPs, which were obtained based on the
                 transcriptome data. Finally, 104 high-quality SNPs and
                 96,819 low-quality SNPs were predicted. Then, 18
                 high-quality SNPs and 17 low-quality SNPs were selected
                 to assess the reliability of the detection process.
                 Here, 72.22\% (13/18) accuracy was achieved for
                 high-quality SNPs, while only 52.94\% (9/17) accuracy
                 was achieved for low-quality SNPs. These SNPs enrich
                 the data for population genetics studies of P. vannamei
                 and may play a role in the development of SNP markers

                 importance of selecting the right data error structure

                 Cynoglossus semilaevis, a species of fish mainly
                 distributed along the west coast of Korea. As its skin
                 is very tough and difficult to process, it is not
                 useful as food. For this reason, most of it is
                 discarded except for a small amount that is used as
                 feed, which results in environmental pollution.
                 Considering this, there is a need for research on the
                 development of functional materials using Cynoglossus
                 semilaevis shell. This study focused on the mechanism
                 of in vitro expression function of \bioname{Cynoglossus
                 semilaevis} shell extract (CSE) for skin tissue in

                 functional material for human skin beauty or wrinkle

                 According to the ELISA results using human dermal
                 fibroblast cells, CSE reduced MMP-1 and elastase
                 activity by up to 21.89\% and 12.04\%, respectively, in
                 a concentration-dependent manner, and increased PIP
                 synthesis by up to 62.24\% in a concentration-dependent
                 manner. The RT-PCR test results using mRNA showed the
                 MMP-1, 2, and 3 expression levels were suppressed in
                 the CSE-treated group compared to the UVB-induced group
                 and caused a concentration-dependent increase in TIMP-1
                 in the CSE-treat group. These results suggest that CSE
                 can maintain and improve skin tissue conditions through
                 MMP/TIMP balancing in human dermal fibroblast cell
                 lines and indicate its potential as a functional

                 susceptibility analysis (PSA) --- a widely used
                 semi-quantitative risk assessment tool for target and
                 non-target fisheries stocks --- for the selected
                 attributes of a given species, no formal comparison has
                 been made between scoring approaches in terms of how
                 well they can predict species vulnerability. The
                 present study evaluated the PSA findings of 21 bycatch
                 stocks of the Hilsa (\bioname{Tenualosa ilisha})
                 gillnet fishery of Bangladesh using two different
                 scoring approaches (the conservative scoring approach,
                 CSA; and the alternative scoring approach, ASA) to
                 determine the most reliable approach to minimize false
                 estimates of species vulnerability. Our analysis
                 revealed that the V scores increased by 0.0\minus 0.20
                 with a mean value of 0.09 for 21 selected bycatches
                 when CSA was applied. The inconsistency between the
                 vulnerability (V)-score-suggested fishing status (V \le
                 1.8 = underfishing, V $>$ 1.8 = overfishing) and the
                 fishing status defined by exploitation rate (E $>$ 0.5
                 = overfishing, E {$<$} 0.5 = underfishing) were 38.1\%
                 and 19.0\% under CSA and ASA, respectively. Likewise,
                 the consistency between the V -score-suggested fishing
                 status and fishers' perceived catch trends was found to
                 be higher when using ASA than when using CSA. Our
                 analysis suggests that CSA could overestimate species
                 vulnerability. Therefore, ASA is more reliable than CSA
                 in PSA, which may increase the confidence of fisheries
                 stakeholders in PSA.",

  abstract =     "Brazilian fish farming goes together with the
                 emergence of numerous bacterial diseases, with
                 \bioname{Aeromonas hydrophila} being the main bacterial
                 pathogen. As a consequence, antimicrobials are
                 excessively used. Considering that antimicrobials are
                 relatively stable and nonbiodegradable, medicinal
                 plants and their phytochemicals have been used as
                 alternative treatments of bacteriosis in fish farming.
                 Limonene is a monoterpene available in two enantiomers:
                 R-(+)-limonene and S-(-)-limonene. This study analyzed
                 the antibacterial activity of the phytochemicals
                 S-(-)-limonene and R-(+)-limonene against some bacteria
                 isolated from silver catfish (\bioname{Rhamdia
                 quelen}). Furthermore, by means of spectrophotometry
                 and atomic force microscopy, we also investigated the
                 combination therapy of phytochemicals with
                 antimicrobials and their activity in terms of
                 inhibiting biofilm formation. Six clinical isolates and
                 a standard strain were selected for antimicrobial
                 activity testing. Biofilm formation was tested in
                 96-well plates and nylon cubes. The most sensitive of
                 the strains tested was the A. hydrophila strain (MF
                 372510). S-(-)-limonene and R-(+)-limonene had high
                 minimum inhibitory concentrations; however, they
                 strongly inhibited A. hydrophila biofilm formation.
                 R-(+)-limonene and S-(-)-limonene had an additive
                 effect when combined with florfenicol and an
                 antagonistic effect with oxytetracycline. In general,
                 the phytochemicals tested showed strong antibiofilm
                 activity against A. hydrophila, and when in combination
                 therapy with florfenicol, they showed an additive
                 effect against the treatment of \bioname{A.

                 evaluate growth and survival. Juvenile dusky grouper
                 were randomly distributed in twelve 100 L tanks
                 containing four fish per aquarium. The fish were
                 exposed to continuous light, normal photoperiod or
                 continuous darkness for 50 days. Fish were fed 3\% of
                 their total biomass, twice a day, and the diet
                 consisted of ground commercial dry pellets (42\% crude
                 protein, 12\% humidity, 9\% ether extract, 15\% mineral
                 matter, 4\% crude fiber, 3.5\% calcium and 3\% vitamin
                 C, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions).
                 There was no mortality during the experiment. After 50
                 days, the best performance was found for exposure to
                 continuous light (24 h artificial light). The final
                 weight of the fish reared under continuous light was
                 significantly higher than that of the fish exposed to
                 continuous darkness. The specific growth rate of the
                 fish exposed to continuous light was significantly
                 higher than that of the fish exposed to the natural
                 photoperiod and to continuous darkness. Modifications
                 to the photoperiod can be a key factor in increasing

                 source in aquafeeds. However, due to the reduction of
                 wild fish stocks used for FM production, its
                 manufacturing it is now unsustainable. Insect meal
                 represents a valid alternative to FM, due to the low
                 carbon footprint of its production and its high
                 nutritional value. The aim of this study was to
                 investigate the potentials of replacing FM with black
                 soldier fly (\bioname{Hermetia illucens}) meal (HIM) in
                 aquafeeds, using zebrafish as the animal model. Four
                 diets were formulated with increasing HIM/FM
                 replacement rate (the control diet contained 20\% FM).
                 Mortality rates, growth performances, and feed
                 consumptions were measured, and fish intestine samples
                 were collected for histological and enzymatic analysis.
                 After 49 days, all groups almost tripled their initial
                 body weight (cumulative body weight gain ranged between
                 143.9 and 155.2 mg), and no statistically significant
                 differences among treatments were observed in relation
                 to growth performances and histological traits.
                 Contrarily, trypsin, alkaline phosphatases, and alpha
                 amylase--glucoamylase activities were significantly
                 reduced when the FM replacement rate was increased. In
                 conclusion, HIM may represent an alternative to FM,
                 since no adverse effects were observed when it was
                 included up to 20\% in the zebrafish diet, even when
                 replacing 100\% of the FM.",

  abstract =     "Community-based monitoring programs (CBMPs) are a
                 cost-effective option to collect the long-term data
                 required to effectively monitor estuaries. Data quality
                 concerns have caused some CBMP datasets, which could
                 fill knowledge gaps for aquatic ecosystems, to go
                 unused. The Community Aquatic Monitoring Program (CAMP)
                 is a CBMP that has collected littoral nekton assemblage
                 data from estuaries in the southern Gulf of St.
                 Lawrence since 2003. Concerns with the CAMP sampling
                 design (station placement and numbers) have prevented
                 decision-makers from using the data to inform estuary
                 health assessments. This study tested if CAMP's
                 sampling design that accommodates volunteer
                 participation provides similar information as a
                 scientific sampling approach. Six CAMP stations and six
                 stations selected using a stratified random design were
                 sampled at ten estuaries. A permutational-MANOVA
                 revealed nekton assemblages were generally not
                 significantly different between the two sampling
                 designs. The current six CAMP stations are sufficient
                 to detect the larger differences in species abundances
                 that may indicate differences in estuary condition. The
                 predicted increase in precision (2\%) with twelve
                 stations is not substantive enough to warrant an
                 increased sampling effort. CAMP's scientific utility is
                 not limited by station selection bias or numbers.
                 Furthermore, well-designed CBMPs can produce comparable
                 data to scientific studies.",

                 freezing. Fresh and post-thaw sperm motility was
                 evaluated by a Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis system,
                 whilst the fertilizing ability was assessed by in vivo
                 trials. In fresh semen, at 3 h of storage, a

                 can be useful in aquaculture due to possible sedative
                 and/or anesthetic effects. Four M. tinctoria extracts
                 were extracted separately with ethanol; leaves (LE),

                 of demersal fishes to environmental variations induced
                 by the changing climate are still not well understood.
                 Here, we collected 21 time series of demersal fishes
                 from 1956 to 2015 to investigate the climate-induced
                 nonstationary responses in temperate waters of the
                 northwestern North Pacific (NWP). We showed that these
                 demersal fishes experienced state shifts in
                 approximately 1986/87, accompanied by abrupt warming
                 over this region. Moreover, the relationships between
                 demersal fishes and sea surface temperature (SST) were
                 found to change between the two identified eras (i.e.,
                 a weak relationship before 1986 and a strong negative
                 relationship after 1986), which may be primarily caused
                 by the alternating dominance of the East Asian winter
                 monsoon and mega-ENSO on SST in temperate waters of the
                 NWP. The identified climate-induced nonstationary
                 responses of demersal fishes to SST variability in this
                 study may provide implications for understanding
                 climate-induced biological dynamics, predicting
                 demersal fish fluctuations, coping with potential
                 ecological risks, and the sustainable exploitation of
                 fishery resources in the future climate. Note that the
                 impact of fishing on the demersal fishes in temperate
                 waters of the NWP was not assessed in this study due to
                 the lack of fishing effort data and therefore the
                 conclusions of our research should be approached with

                 body composition, dressing yield, blood parameters,
                 immunity) and economic performances. Therefore, 750
                 fingerlings (~20.0 g) were distributed into five groups
                 of 150 fingerlings/group with three replicates (n = 50)
                 per group. Group 1 was fed a basal diet, while G2 and
                 G3 were fed diets containing 25\% SBp (autoclaved and
                 acid-treated, respectively) as soybean replacer for 12
                 weeks, while, in G4 and G5, SBp level was 50\%. All
                 growth and nutrient utilization parameters (body
                 weight, Wg, ADG, PER, FCR, and digestibility), plasma
                 proteins, and immunity significantly increased in G4
                 and G5. Anemia screening markers recorded insignificant
                 differences between the tested groups and control one,
                 whereas lipid markers of plasma and fish body decreased
                 by autoclaved SBp and increased by acid-treated SBp.
                 The African catfish body dry matter and crude protein
                 percentages were enriched by the addition of SBp.
                 Replacing the soybean meal decreases diet costs and
                 diet costs/1 kg of weight gain. In conclusion,
                 replacing soybean with SBp (especially 50\%
                 acid-treated) positively influenced productive and
                 economic performances with friendly effects to avoid
                 the environmental pollution by these wastes.",

                 important role in the growth and development of

                 association between the Smad3 gene and the growth
                 traits of mollusks. In this study, Smad3 from the hard
                 clam \bioname{Meretrix meretrix} (Mm-Smad3) was cloned,
                 characterized, and screened for growth-related single
                 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its exons. The
                 full-length cDNA of Mm-Smad3 was 1938 bp, encoding a
                 protein with 428 amino acid residues. The protein
                 sequence included an MH1 (27--135 aa) and MH2 domain
                 (233--404 aa). Promoter analysis showed that the
                 promoter sequence of Mm-Smad3 was 2548 bp, and the
                 binding sites of Pit-1a, Antp, Hb, and other
                 transcription factors are related to the growth and
                 development of hard clams. The phylogenetic tree was
                 divided into two major clusters, including mollusks and
                 vertebrate. The expression level of Mm-Smad3 was
                 predominantly detected in the mantle and foot, while
                 extremely less expression was observed in the digestive
                 gland. The low expression level of Mm-Smad3 was
                 detected at the stages of unfertilized mature eggs,
                 fertilized eggs, four-cell embryos, blastula,
                 gastrulae, trochophore, and D-shaped larvae, whereas an
                 opposite trend was observed regarding the highest
                 expression at the umbo larvae stage (p {$<$} 0.05). In
                 the mantle repair experiment, the time-course
                 expression profiles showed that compared to the
                 expression level at 0 h, Mm-Smad3 significantly
                 decreased at 6 h (p {$<$} 0.05) but increased at 12 and
                 48 h. Further, the association analysis identified 11
                 SNPs in the exons of Mm-Smad3, of which three loci
                 (c.597 C $>$ T, c.660 C $>$ T, c.792 A $>$ T) were
                 significantly related to the growth traits of clam (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). Overall, our findings indicated that
                 Mm-Smad3 is a growth-related gene and the detected SNP
                 sites provide growth-related markers for molecular

                 and 17RbGs were 112,360 and 112,235 bp long,
                 respectively (115 and 114 open reading frames [ORFs],

                 in regions encoding functional proteins (a DNA-binding

                 survival rates differed significantly between
                 17SbTy-infected and 17RbGs-infected rock breams,

                 correct management of water resources. Flat-V gauging
                 weirs are facilities used worldwide for measuring
                 discharge. These structures consist of a small weir
                 with a triangular cross-section and a flat ``V''-shaped
                 notch. Their extensive use is a consequence of their
                 utility in the measurement of both low and high flow
                 conditions. However, depending on their size, local
                 morphology and river discharge can act as full or
                 partial hydraulic barriers to fish migration. To
                 address this concern, the present work studies fish
                 passage performance over flat-V weirs considering their
                 hydraulic performance. For this, radio-tracking and
                 video-monitoring observations were combined with
                 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in two flat-V
                 weirs, using Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) as
                 the target species. Results showed that fish passage is
                 conditioned by both hydraulic and behavioral processes,
                 providing evidence for scenarios in which flat-V weirs
                 may act as full or partial barriers to upstream
                 movements. For the studied flat-V weirs, a discharge
                 range of 0.27--8 m 3 /s, with a water drop difference
                 between upstream and downstream water levels lower than
                 0.7 m and a depth downstream of the weir of higher than
                 0.3 m can be considered an effective passage situation
                 for barbels. These findings are of interest for
                 quantifying flat-V weir impacts, for engineering
                 applications and for establishing managing or

                 (\bioname{Trichiurus lepturus}, also known as T.
                 japonicus) is a commercially important element of
                 Chinese fisheries. Hairtail has long been widely
                 exploited. Due to overfishing, however, its production
                 declined over the years. One of solutions to this
                 dilemma is to institute reasonable fishery policies.
                 Generally, skillful short-term and long-term prediction
                 of fish catch is a central tool for guiding the
                 development of fishery policy. Accurate predictions
                 require a comprehensive understanding of the
                 relationship between fluctuations in fish catch and
                 variability in both fishing effort and marine
                 environmental conditions. To investigate the combined
                 impact of fishing effort and marine environments on
                 hairtail catch and to develop models to predict
                 hairtail catch, we applied empirical dynamic modeling
                 (EDM) to data on East China Sea fisheries, including
                 hairtail catch, fishing effort, and marine
                 environmental factors. EDM is an equation-free approach
                 that enables the investigation of various complex
                 systems. We constructed all possible multivariate EDM
                 models to investigate the potential mechanisms
                 affecting hairtail catch. Our analysis demonstrates
                 that all key environmental factors (salinity, summer
                 monsoon, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and
                 power dissipation index of tropical cyclones) have an
                 impact on nutrient supply, which we suggest is the
                 central factor influencing hairtail catch. Finally, our
                 comparison of EDM models with parametric models
                 demonstrates that EDM models overwhelmingly outperform
                 parametric models in analysis of these complex

                 gene, plays an important role in the absorption of
                 glutamine. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence
                 of ASCT2 was cloned from triploid crucian carp. It
                 encodes 539 amino acid residues and a stop codon.
                 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences of
                 the ASCT2 ORF region in cyprinid fishes shared high
                 sequence homology. Comparing the abundance of ASCT2 in
                 different tissues, we found its expression level in
                 muscle was significantly higher than that in intestine
                 (p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, the expression levels of
                 ASCT2 also appeared different in diurnal variation.
                 Then we found the addition of 2.5\% glutamate in a
                 feeding diet significantly increased the expression
                 levels of ASCT2 in intestine and muscle (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 However, in glutamine experiments, the muscle showed
                 the highest expression level of ASCT2 when fish were
                 fed the diet containing 3.0\% glutamine (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 In vitro, ASCT2 was sensitive to glutamine and its
                 expression level appeared down-regulated when the
                 addition of glutamine was added to 0.1 mg/mL. Finally,
                 we found that the diet with 29\% protein level
                 significantly increased the expression level of ASCT2
                 in intestine (p {$<$} 0.05). Nevertheless, different
                 protein sources (fish meal and soybean meal) had no
                 significant effect on the expression levels of ASCT2 in
                 intestine and muscle (p $>$ 0.05). These results
                 provided data for the study of ASCT2 in triploid
                 crucian carp regulated by feeding nutrition, which had
                 a potential application in improving feed formulation

                 administered as single or multiple mixtures. The
                 expected benefits of probiotics include disease
                 prophylaxis, improved growth, and feed conversion
                 parameters, such as the feed conversion rate (FCR) and
                 specific growth rate (SGR). In the current work, we
                 review the impact of probiotics on freshwater finfish
                 aquaculture. Data were gathered from articles published
                 during the last decade that examined the effects of
                 probiotics on fish growth, FCR, and water quality in
                 freshwater fishponds/tanks. While the expected benefits
                 of probiotics are significant, the reviewed data
                 indicate a range in the level of effects, with an
                 average reduction in ammonia of 50.7\%, SGR increase of
                 17.1\%, and FCR decrease of 10.7\%. Despite the
                 variability in the reported benefits, probiotics appear
                 to offer a practical solution for sustainable
                 freshwater aquaculture. Disease prophylaxis with
                 probiotics can reduce the need for antibiotics and
                 maintain gut health and feed conversion. Considering
                 that fish feed and waste are two significant parameters
                 of the aquaculture ecological footprint, it can be
                 argued that probiotics can contribute to reducing the
                 environmental impact of aquaculture. In this direction,
                 it would be beneficial if more researchers incorporated
                 water quality parameters in future aquaculture research
                 and protocols to minimize aquaculture's environmental

                 nonnative fish can include agonistic behaviors that
                 push native fish species out of their preferred
                 habitat, including their thermal optima. To examine
                 these interactions, we built an experimental thermal
                 preference chamber to evaluate: (1) the thermal
                 preference of native, glacial relict northern redbelly
                 dace \bioname{Chrosomus eos}; (2) if the thermal

                 invasive western mosquitofish \bioname{Gambusia

                 interactions. We hypothesized that G. affinis would
                 express agonistic behavior toward C. eos, because G.
                 affinis is widely recognized as an aggressive invader.
                 Given the temperature range of the experimental
                 chamber, i.e., 20--30 {$^\circ $}C, C. eos selected an
                 average of 24.3 {$^\circ $}C as its thermal preference.
                 After G. affinis ' introduction, the thermal preference
                 of C. eos increased by 1.7 {$^\circ $}C and the
                 movement, given by distance (cm) travelled, increased
                 by 21\%. Contrary to our prediction, more agonistic
                 interactions were observed in C. eos toward G. affinis.
                 These results indicate that agonistic behavior of G.
                 affinis toward native fish species may be species- and
                 condition-specific, and may not always be the primary
                 mechanism of native species' displacement. Biological
                 invasions are a global issue and altered thermal
                 regimes are expected to continue. This study provided
                 the novel approach using of a thermally heterogeneous
                 thermal chamber to examine thermal preferences and
                 aggressive interactions between a native and an

                 life history traits that may be conveying the

                 Developing-country fish farmers use manual feeding to
                 be more cost-effective than with costly mechanized

                 years of scientific surveys across the Ningaloo Reef
                 World Heritage Area, we recorded a total of 155
                 individuals of B. muricatum across 63.2 ha of reef
                 crest surveys, equating to mean density of 2.38 ind/ha.

                 densities since 2006. The densities of B. muricatum
                 observed at northern Ningaloo in 2021 suggest this

                 productive activity in this system. The objective of
                 this research was to evaluate the concentration of Pb
                 and Cd in the muscle tissue of native and invasive fish
                 species in this area. For this, the digestion of fish
                 muscle samples was carried out with a CEM MARS 5
                 Digestion Microwave System, while the quantification of
                 metals was performed with an atomic absorption
                 equipment. All analysis muscle samples from native and
                 invasive fish showed Pb and Cd in their content. By
                 sampling site there was a statistically significant
                 difference (p {$<$} 0.05), with a maximum Pb
                 concentration of 7.760 $ \mu $ g g {-1} at the LLAR
                 site (Laguna Larga). In terms of species, the maximum
                 Cd concentration was obtained in the \bioname{Cyprinus
                 carpio} with 6.630 {\pm} 0.127 and in Pterygoplichthus
                 pardalis with 6.547 {\pm} 0.873 $ \mu $ g g {-1} (dry
                 weight). The presence of metals such as Pb and Cd in
                 muscle tissue of native and invasive fish species
                 represents an important bioindicator of environmental
                 exposure in the study area and a potential risk to
                 public health, as these species are commonly
                 consumed.",

                 communities have received little attention when used as
                 biological tags for identifying fish stocks. This study
                 evaluated the potential spatial and temporal
                 variability of the parasite communities affecting three
                 marine fish species collected between 1993 and 2017. To
                 avoid the potential effect of host age in parasite
                 communities, individuals of similar ages were selected:
                 1123 \bioname{Engraulis ringens} (12--24 months old),
                 1904 \bioname{Trachurus murphyi} (24--36 months old),
                 and 630 \bioname{Merluccius gayi} (36--48 months old).
                 Most taxa show differences in the prevalence at the
                 spatial and temporal scales, but the prevalence of some
                 larval endoparasites remains constant at the temporal
                 scale. At the spatial scale, an analysis of similarity
                 (ANOSIM) showed differences in the parasite communities
                 of three species; a canonical analysis of principal
                 coordinates (CAP) showed low values of correct
                 allocations (CA; {\SGMLasymp}50\%) and values of
                 allocation due to chance (AdC) were lower than the CA.
                 At the temporal scale, an ANOSIM showed differences
                 between the three species. A CAP showed low values of
                 CA ({\SGMLasymp}50--60\%) and the AdC was always lower
                 than CA. Samples at the spatial scale were well
                 allocated to their localities or nearby localities,
                 suggesting a spatial stability. Samples from different
                 years were not well discriminated, suggesting temporal
                 variability. Therefore, in studies regarding parasites
                 as a tool for stock identification, temporal
                 variability must be taken into account.",

                 we report the molecular evolution of the parvalbumin
                 genes in bony fishes based on 19 whole genomes and 70
                 transcriptomes. We found unexpectedly high parvalbumin
                 diversity in teleosts; three main gene types
                 (pvalb-{\alpha}, pvalb-{\beta}1, and pvalb-{\beta}2,
                 including oncomodulins) originated at the onset of
                 vertebrates. Teleosts have further multiplied the
                 parvalbumin gene repertoire up to nine ancestral
                 copies---two copies of pvalb-{\alpha}, two copies of
                 pvalb-{\beta}1, and five copies of pvalb-{\beta}2. This
                 gene diversity is a result of teleost-specific
                 whole-genome duplication. Two conserved parvalbumin
                 genomic clusters carry pvalb-{\beta}1 and {\beta}2
                 copies, whereas pvalb-{\alpha} genes are located
                 separately in different linkage groups. Further, we
                 investigated parvalbumin gene expression in 17 tissues
                 of the common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus carpio}), a
                 species with 21 parvalbumin genes in its genome. Two
                 pvalb-{\alpha} and eight pvalb-{\beta}2 copies are
                 highly expressed in the muscle, while two alternative
                 pvalb-{\alpha} copies show expression in the brain and
                 the testes, and pvalb-{\beta}1 is dominant in the
                 retina and the kidney. The recent pairs of muscular
                 pvalb-{\beta}2 genes show differential expression in
                 this species. We provide robust genomic evidence of the

                 are now found in fresh as well as marine waters, where
                 they alter habitats, compete with native fish for food,
                 and prey on native fishes, exerting both indirect and
                 direct effects on ecosystems and economies. While

                 article serves as an introduction to these articles
                 which focus on 5 topics on invasive freshwater fish:
                 (1) the damage they cause (one article); (2) techniques
                 to ascertain their presence (one article); (3)
                 techniques to restrict their movement (one article);
                 (4) strategies to control them (three articles); and
                 (5) lessons learned from ongoing management efforts
                 (five articles). This introduction notes that
                 successful management efforts share a few approaches:
                 (1) they develop and use a deep understanding of local
                 species and their abundance as well as distribution;
                 (2) they focus on reducing reproductive success; (3)
                 they use multiple complimentary control strategies; and
                 (4) they use a long-term approach.",

                 extrapolated to infinity (AUC INF_obs) of 25,261.62

                 fishes, but it relies on differences in underlying
                 geology that may occur over large spatial scales. An
                 examination of how small a spatial scale on which this

                 bodies that share a large proportion of their flow,

                 in northern pike (\bioname{Esox lucius}) otoliths to
                 estimate their provenance between two reservoirs in the
                 Upper Yampa River Basin, Colorado, USA. This is a
                 challenging study area as these reservoirs are only
                 11-rkm apart on the same river and thus share a high
                 proportion of their inflow. We found that three
                 isotopes (86 Sr, 137 Ba, and 55 Mn) were useful in
                 discriminating between these reservoirs, but their
                 signatures varied annually, and the values overlapped.
                 Strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) were different
                 between sites and relatively stable across three years,
                 which made them an ideal marker for determining
                 northern pike provenance. Our study demonstrates the
                 usefulness of otolith microchemistry for natal origin
                 determination within the same river over a relatively
                 small spatial scale when there are geologic differences
                 between sites, especially geologic differences

                 of 17--24 \degree C, the survival rate of crucian carp
                 could reach more than 93\%, and at the temperature of
                 24 \degree C, the specific growth rate reached the
                 highest value of 43.29\%. Therefore, the most favorable
                 temperature for the long-term breeding of crucian carp
                 was found to be 24 \degree C. This study provides a
                 favorable experimental basis for the establishment of
                 intelligent aquaculture systems and the setting of

                 movement is a powerful way to analyze animal behavior.
                 Both humans and fish can judge the physiological state
                 through the skeleton framework. However, it is
                 challenging for farmers to judge the breeding state in
                 the complex underwater environment. Therefore, images
                 can be transmitted by the underwater camera and
                 monitored by a computer vision model. However, it lacks
                 datasets in artificial intelligence and is unable to
                 train deep neural networks. The main contributions of
                 this paper include: (1) the world's first fish posture
                 database is established. 10 key points of each fish are
                 manually marked. The fish flock images were taken in
                 the experimental tank and 1000 single fish images were
                 separated from the fish flock. (2) A two-stage attitude
                 estimation model is used to detect fish key points. The
                 evaluation of the algorithm performance indicates the
                 precision of detection reaches 90.61\%, F1-score
                 reaches 90\%, and Fps also reaches 23.26. We made a
                 preliminary exploration on the pose estimation of fish

                 Fisheries Policy (Article 15 of the European Regulation
                 No. 1380/2013). This regulation introduced a discard

                 and release. Candidate species should be evaluated for

                 we assessed not only survival, but also physiological
                 recovery rates of blackspot seabream (\bioname{Pagellus

                 hookline called `` voracera '' in the Strait of

                 onboard a commercial fishing vessel were paralleled

                 where the capture process was mimicked, and
                 physiological recovery markers were described. Our
                 results confirmed that hookline capture induced acute
                 stress responses in the target species, such as changes
                 in plasma cortisol, lactate, glucose, and osmolality.
                 However, 90.6\% of the blackspot seabreams below
                 commercial size captured with this fishing gear managed
                 to survive, and evidenced physiological recovery
                 responses 5 h after capture, with complete homeostatic
                 recovery occurring within the first 24 h. Based on this
                 study, the European Commission approved an exemption
                 from the discard (EU Commission Delegated Regulation
                 6794/2018). Thus, the robust methodology described

                 individuals tolerated CEO inclusion without
                 compromising growth performance, it significantly
                 reduced glycogen in the CEO2 group, concomitant to an

                 crop farming to white leg shrimp production is
                 widespread in Vietnam's Mekong Delta provinces.
                 However, this conversion trend also contains many risks
                 related to the technical aspects of the production
                 process. The study mainly aims to estimate the
                 technical efficiency of white leg shrimp farming. It
                 also compares the technical efficiency of white leg
                 shrimp farming between the traditional group that
                 historically has cultivated white leg shrimp and the
                 group that recently converted from black tiger shrimp
                 and crops to white leg shrimp, in order to evaluate the
                 efficiency and adaptability of shrimp farming. Primary
                 data were collected by directly interviewing 99 farmers
                 in traditional areas and 101 farmers in recently
                 converted areas in the study sites and analyzed by
                 using the stochastic frontier method. The calculated
                 technical efficiency was around 72.9 percent,
                 suggesting that farmers could increase their output
                 level by about 27.1\%, given constant inputs. There was
                 no difference in the technical efficiency of the two
                 groups, indicating that the converted farms have
                 sufficient adaptability when switching to white leg
                 shrimp farming. The output loss in farmers' production
                 is still very high, with an average loss of 1973

  abstract =     "Fish often undergo food shortages in nature,
                 especially for juveniles that are relatively vulnerable
                 in most aspects. Therefore, the effects of food
                 deprivation on fish behavior and physiology are worth
                 exploring. Here, we investigated the behavioral and
                 metabolic adaptations of the juvenile black rockfish
                 \bioname{Sebastes schlegelii} to different durations of
                 food deprivation. In this study, three treatments were
                 set: control group, short-term food deprivation (STFD)
                 group, and long-term food deprivation (LTFD) group. The
                 rearing lasted for six weeks. During this period,
                 videos were recorded three times per week to assess the
                 locomotor activity and aggression. After this, the
                 fishes' boldness, neophobia, and aggressiveness were
                 assessed using different behavioral assessment devices,
                 while the standard metabolic rate (SMR) was measured by
                 flow-type respirometry. In general, the values of the
                 four indicators (swimming time, the number of turns,
                 movement number, and attack number) for the STFD group
                 were significantly higher than those for the control
                 and LTFD group during the same period of rearing. In a
                 subsequent personality assessment, the STFD group was
                 observed to be significantly bolder in an assessment
                 measuring boldness than the control and LTFD group
                 (indicated by time in the circle, swimming time, number
                 of times through the circle, and frequency in the
                 circle). The LTFD group was observed to be more
                 exploratory in the assessment of neophobia (indicated
                 by duration in the exploratory area, distance from
                 novelty item, and frequency of stay in the exploratory
                 area). Indeed, the LTFD group was observed to be
                 significantly less aggressive in the assessment of
                 aggressiveness than the control and STFD group
                 (indicated by attack number, attack range frequency,
                 first attack, and winner). SMR was noted to be
                 significantly higher in the STFD group than in the
                 control and LTFD group. In conclusion, this study
                 firstly reported the effects of food deprivation
                 duration on the personalities of black rockfish, as
                 well as the behavioral and physiological mechanisms.
                 Thus, we hope to provide insights into the work of

                 is a representative catadromous invertebrate of the
                 Yangtze River and a commercial species widely
                 cultivated in China. Both cultivated and wild crabs
                 suffer from a variety of parasites and pathogens, which
                 can result in catastrophic economic losses in
                 aquaculture revenue. Polyascus gregaria, a parasitic
                 barnacle with a highly derived morphology, is
                 specialized in invading these crabs. This study
                 examines the immunological mechanism in E. sinensis
                 infected with P. gregaria. Tandem mass tags (TMT), a
                 specialized method of mass-spectrometry, was used to
                 analyze the infection by P. gregaria resistance at the
                 protein level. In the hepatopancreas of infected crabs,
                 598 proteins differentially expressed relating to
                 physiological change, of which, 352 were upregulated
                 and 246 were downregulated. Based on this differential
                 protein expression, 104 GO terms and 13 KEGG pathways
                 were significantly enriched. Differentially expressed
                 proteins, such as ATG, cathepsin, serpin, iron-related
                 protein, Rab family, integrin, and lectin, are
                 associated with the lysosome GO term and the
                 autophagy-animal KEGG pathways, both of which likely
                 relate to the immune response to the parasitic P.
                 gregaria infection. These results show the benefit of
                 taking a detailed, protein-level approach to
                 understanding the innate immune response of aquatic
                 invertebrates to macroparasite infection.",

                 lake virus (TiLV), is an emerging fish virus that
                 primarily affects tilapines. However, the virus has
                 also been detected in a few non-tilapines. As tilapia
                 is generally farmed in polyculture systems along with
                 carps in South Asian countries, there is a likelihood
                 that TiLV-infected tilapia can transmit the virus to
                 the co-cultured species. In view of the above, the
                 susceptibility of three carp species, namely catla
                 (\bioname{Catla catla}), mrigal (\bioname{Cirrhinus
                 mrigala}) and silver carp (\bioname{Hypophthalmichthys
                 molitrix}) was evaluated vis-{\`a}-vis tilapia,
                 following experimental infection with TiLV. No clinical
                 signs and histopathological alterations could be
                 observed in carps. RT-qPCR revealed that TiLV copy
                 numbers in liver and brain of all the three carps were
                 almost negligible and did not show any increase with
                 time, suggesting that the virus did not replicate in
                 liver and brain, the target organs of TiLV. Further,
                 TiLV could not be isolated from pooled liver and brain
                 tissues of carps using permissive CFF cell line. On the
                 contrary, in tilapia, typical clinical signs and
                 histopathological lesions were observed and there was
                 significant increase in TiLV copy number up to 6 days
                 post-injection. Furthermore, the virus was successfully
                 isolated from pooled liver and brain tissue of infected
                 tilapia. From the above findings, it could be concluded
                 that C. catla, C. mrigala and H. molitrix are resistant

                 diurnal and nocturnal, with high adaptability and

                 are associated with sensitive dynamic visual acuity, we

                 cells, i.e., the rod, single, and double cone cells of

                 Aeromonas septicemia, caused by virulent
                 \bioname{Aeromonas hydrophila} (vAh), is one of the
                 most severe diseases that afflict catfish farms.
                 Previously, vaccination of fish with extracellular
                 proteins (ECP) of vAh was shown to produce a robust
                 antibody-mediated immune response against vAh
                 infection. In this study, we analyzed IgM transcripts
                 that were differentially expressed in the head kidney
                 and liver of ECP-immunized and mock-immunized (control)
                 fish with emphasis on a variable domain of heavy chain.
                 Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that immunized fish
                 produced significantly more IgM transcripts than
                 control fish. Full-length IgM heavy chain cDNA was
                 cloned, which encoded typical IgM peptide, including
                 signal peptide, variable domain (VH), constant domain
                 (CH), and carboxyl terminal peptide. Great sequence
                 diversity was revealed in a VH segment, with the third
                 complementarity diversity region (CDR3) being most
                 variable. Using germline VH gene grouping method,
                 variants (clones) of VH characterized in this study
                 belonged to nine VH families. The most unique variants
                 (approximately 49\%) were found in the VH2 family.
                 Vaccinated fish apparently had more unique variants
                 than in the control fish. There were 62\% and 79\% of
                 unique variants in the head kidney and liver of
                 vaccinated fish, respectively, while 44\% and 27\%
                 unique variants in the head kidney and liver of control
                 fish, respectively. Among the unique variants in VH2
                 family, approximately 87\% of them were found in
                 vaccinated fish. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of
                 semi-purified IgM protein confirmed that matured IgM
                 protein was as variable as IgM transcripts identified
                 in this study, with isoelectric points crossing from 6
                 to 10. Results of this study provided insight into the
                 molecular and genetic basis of antibody diversity and
                 enriched our knowledge of the complex interplay between

  abstract =     "Coilia grayii is the anadromous form of anchovy that
                 is distributed in the East and South China Seas. It is
                 a common fish species in the estuarine area of the
                 Pearl River. Nevertheless, freshwater populations
                 appear upstream in the Pearl River, but the migratory
                 pathway has been mostly impeded by dam construction.
                 Behavioral differences and constrained habitat within
                 tributaries are suspected of promoting genetic
                 divergence in these populations. In this study, we
                 investigated the migratory behavior and genetic
                 divergence of six populations of C. grayii fragmented
                 by dams based on the otolith strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca)
                 ratio, mitochondrial DNA, and microsatellite
                 genotyping. All populations were in freshwater with low
                 Sr/Ca ratios, except the estuarine population (Humen
                 population) hatched in brackish water. Reduced
                 nucleotide diversity corresponding to distance was
                 observed. Populations from distant hydrological regions
                 exhibited a decline in genetic diversity and a
                 significant difference with the remaining populations
                 after fitting the isolation by distance model. Pairwise
                 fixation indices confirmed these results and moderate
                 and significant differentiation was found between
                 Hengxian site and downstream sites. Furthermore,
                 STRUCTURE analyses revealed that all separated
                 populations exhibited an admixed phylogenetic pattern
                 except for individuals from the Hengxian locality. The
                 upstream sites showed significantly increased
                 resistance to gene flow from the estuarine population
                 because of isolation by the dam. The results of the
                 neutrality test and Bayesian skyline plots demonstrated
                 complex demography---individuals' experienced
                 historical expansion and partial upper-dam populations
                 had recently undergone a colonization, forming a new
                 genetic structure. Accordingly, this study demonstrates
                 differences in the migration pattern and genetic
                 differentiation of C. grayii as a consequence of
                 demographic history and current processes (habitat

                 the welfare of rainbow trout in relation to inadequate
                 husbandry conditions. A feeding stress model based on
                 dietary soybean meal was employed to identify suitable
                 minimally invasive ``classical'' stress markers,
                 together with molecular signatures. In a 56-day feeding
                 experiment, rainbow trout were fed diets containing
                 different levels of soybean meal. The impact of these
                 different soybean meal diets on rainbow trout was
                 assessed by water quality analyses, clinical health
                 observations, classic growth and performance
                 parameters, gut histopathology, blood-parameter
                 measurements and multigene-expression profiling in RNA
                 from whole blood. Soybean meal-induced enteritis was
                 manifested phenotypically by an inflammatory reaction
                 in the posterior section of the intestine and by
                 diarrhoea in some trout. These inflammatory changes
                 were associated with decreased supranuclear
                 vacuolation. The haematocrit values and the levels of
                 plasma cortisol and circulating lymphocytes in the
                 blood were increased in trout that had consumed high
                 amounts of SBM. Notably, the increased haematocrit
                 depended significantly on the bodyweight of the
                 individual trout. The transcript levels of certain
                 genes (e.g., MAP3K1, LYG, NOD1, STAT1 and HSP90AB)
                 emerged as potentially useful indicators in the blood
                 of rainbow trout providing valuable information about
                 inadequate nutrition. The expression-profiling findings
                 provide a basis for improved, minimally invasive
                 monitoring of feeding regimens in trout farming and may

                 an infrequently studied species making their biology,

                 limited information has been published on black

                 seasonal diet preferences in a northern Wisconsin lake.
                 Using common fish collection gears (fyke netting,

                 rates, early ages at maturity, moderate fecundity, and
                 a diverse omnivorous diet. Due to these demographic and
                 life history characteristics, black bullheads have the
                 potential to dominate fish community biomass in their
                 native and introduced range. Results from our study may

                 Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was used as a proxy to
                 estimate the efficiency of commercial fishing and,
                 subsequently, the potential biomass of fishes. The

                 fishing areas and corresponding commercial catches and
                 CPUE was analyzed using multivariate analysis. The
                 total catch values and CPUE used in the analyses were
                 derived from the official commercial fishery records.
                 RDE analysis was used to assess the variation of both
                 catch and CPUE of commercial fish species, while the
                 percentages of bottom sediment type coverage, average

                 each of the fishing squares were used as explanatory

                 allowed for the use of non-Euclidean dissimilarity
                 indices. Fisheries data spatial distribution map
                 indicated the lack of coherence between the spatial
                 patterns of commercial catches and CPUE distribution in
                 the northern part of the lagoon. Highest CPUE values

  abstract =     "Diseases of crucian carp (\bioname{Carassius auratus})
                 are closely related to intestinal parameters.
                 Enterococcus faecalis has strong colonization ability
                 in the intestinal tract, and produces natural
                 antibiotics, bacteriocin, and other bacteriostatic
                 substances, which can effectively inhibit some
                 pathogenic bacteria and improve the intestinal
                 microenvironment. This study aimed to assess the
                 effects of E. faecalis YFI-G720 which was isolated from
                 the intestinal of crucian carp on the growth, immunity,
                 intestinal health, and disease resistance of crucian
                 carp. Fish (48.16 {\pm} 0.55 g) were fed four diets,
                 commercial diet or diet containing E. faecalis at 10 5
                 CFU/g (EF1), 10 6 CFU/g (EF2), or 10 7 CFU/g (EF3) for
                 28 days. The results showed that supplementation of E.
                 faecalis significantly improved the weight gain ratio
                 (WGR) and the specific growth rate (SGR) compared with
                 control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Intestinal mucosal
                 epithelial cells in EF2 were intact and normal, but
                 there was obvious vacuolation in CG. Compared with CG,
                 serum C3 and IgM in EF2 were significantly increased at
                 the end of the experiment (p {$<$} 0.05), and serum
                 alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in all
                 experimental groups (p {$<$} 0.05). Among studied
                 immune-related genes, expression was detected by qPCR,
                 C3, IgM, and IL-1{\beta}were upregulated in all
                 experimental groups to varying degrees from 14 days,
                 with highest expression in EF2 at 28 days. Intestinal
                 microbiota structure analyzed through high-throughput
                 sequencing, and the results showed that the relative
                 abundance of Aeromonas and Acinetobacter decreased
                 while Cetobacterium increased in all experimental
                 groups, with the greatest changes in EF2. Challenge
                 tests showed that fish fed E. faecalis were more
                 resistant to \bioname{Aeromonas veronii} (p {$<$}
                 0.05). In conclusion, dietary E. faecalis YFI-G720 at
                 10 6 CFU/g can improve the health status, immune
                 parameters, intestinal microbiota composition, and
                 disease resistance of crucian carp.",

  abstract =     "Large yellow croaker (\bioname{Larimichthys crocea}),
                 an economically important marine fish in China, has
                 suffered from serious vibriosis, which has resulted in
                 great economic losses for the large yellow croaker
                 industry. Vaccination has been considered to be a safe
                 and effective method to prevent and control vibriosis.
                 However, due to the complex diversity and serotypes of
                 the Vibrio genus, the progress of Vibrio vaccine
                 development is still slow. In this study, we prepared
                 recombinant Vibrio dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase
                 (rDLD) protein and investigated its potential as a
                 candidate to be a subunit vaccine against Vibrio. The
                 lysozyme activity and the rDLD-specific antibody level
                 in sera of large yellow croakers immunized with rDLD
                 were significantly higher than those in the control
                 group, and the transcript levels of proinflammatory
                 cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{\beta}), MHC
                 II{\alpha}/{\beta}, CD40, CD8{\alpha}, IL-4/13A, and
                 IL-4/13B were significantly up-regulated in the spleen
                 and head kidney of large yellow croakers immunized with
                 rDLD, suggesting that rDLD could induce both specific
                 and nonspecific immune responses in this species. In
                 addition, rDLD protein increased the survival rate of
                 large yellow croakers against \bioname{Vibrio
                 alginolyticus} and \bioname{Vibrio parahaemolyticus},
                 with the relative percent of survival (RPS) being
                 74.5\% and 66.9\%, respectively. These results will
                 facilitate the development of a potential subunit
                 vaccine against Vibrio in large yellow croaker
                 aquaculture.",

  abstract =     "In ectotherm species, environmental temperature plays
                 a key role in development, growth, and survival. Thus,
                 determining how temperature affects fish populations is
                 of utmost importance to accurately predict the risk of
                 climate change over fisheries and aquaculture, critical
                 to warrant nutrition and food security in the coming
                 years. Here, the potential effects of abnormal thermal
                 regimes (24, 28 and 32 {$^\circ $}C; TR24, TR28, and
                 TR32, respectively) exclusively applied during
                 embryogenesis in tropical gar (\bioname{Atractosteus
                 tropicus}) has been explored to decipher the potential
                 consequences on hatching and growth from fertilization
                 to 16 days post-fertilization (dpf), while effects on
                 skeletal development and body morphology were explored
                 at fertilization and 16 dpf. Egg incubation at higher
                 temperatures induced an early hatching and mouth
                 opening. A higher hatching rate was obtained in eggs
                 incubated at 28 {$^\circ $}C when compared to those at
                 24 {$^\circ $}C. No differences were found in fish
                 survival at 16 dpf, with values ranging from 84.89 to
                 88.86\%, but increased wet body weight and standard
                 length were found in larvae from TR24 and TR32 groups.
                 Thermal regime during embryogenesis also altered the
                 rate at which the skeletal development occurs. Larvae
                 from the TR32 group showed an advanced skeletal
                 development, with a higher development of cartilaginous
                 structures at hatching but reduced at 16 dpf when
                 compared with the TR24 and TR28 groups. Furthermore,
                 this advanced skeletal development seemed to determine
                 the fish body morphology. Based on biometric measures,
                 a principal component analysis showed how along
                 development, larvae from each thermal regime were
                 clustered together, but with each population remaining
                 clearly separated from each other. The current study
                 shows how changes in temperature may induce
                 craniofacial and morphological alterations in fish
                 during early stages and contribute to understanding the
                 possible effects of global warming in early development
                 of fish and its ecological implications.",

                 species. The changes in gene expression in the
                 epidermis of yellowtail by silkrose treatment were also

  abstract =     "Fisheries in the Curonian Lagoon (1584 km 2 coastal
                 lagoon in South-East Baltic) can be classified as
                 artisanal, small-scale, multi-species, and multi-gear.
                 Such types of fisheries are characterised as data-poor
                 and require appropriate investigation methods. We used
                 CMSY (version CMSY_2019_9f. R) to assess maximum
                 sustainable yield (MSY) and related indicators for
                 freshwater bream, roach, pike-perch, and European
                 perch. A decline in pike-perch and roach was
                 identified, while the stocks of freshwater bream and
                 European perch were sustained. As the CMSY model does
                 not consider the impact of environmental factors, the
                 decline in roach stock may be attributed to the
                 increase in salinity rather than to overfishing. In the
                 case of freshwater bream and pike-perch, the method
                 cannot consider the increase of the percentage of
                 small-sized fishes in catches due to the allowance of
                 low-selectivity gears in the fishery. Additionally, in
                 the case of the pike-perch, the model does not take
                 into account the interannual fluctuations in the
                 stock-recruitment system. The assessment of the
                 European perch stock can be considered to be good.
                 However, the accuracy of CMSY is limited, and it should
                 be used for fisheries management only in combination
                 with other methods.",

  abstract =     "To be as accurate as possible, stock assessments
                 should account for discard mortality in fisheries if it
                 occurs. Three common approaches to modeling discards in
                 assessments are to lump dead discards with landings,
                 treat dead discards as their own fleet, or link them
                 conversely with landings through use of a retention
                 function. The first approach (lumping) implicitly
                 assumes that the selectivity of landings applies also
                 to discards. In many cases, that assumption is false,
                 for example, if discards comprise smaller fish than do
                 landings. The latter two approaches avoid the
                 assumption by modeling discards explicitly with their
                 own selectivity pattern. Here, we examine these
                 approaches to modeling discards. Using a simulation
                 study, we demonstrate that the two approaches to
                 modeling discards explicitly can provide identical
                 results under both static and time-varying conditions.
                 Then, using a stock assessment case study of red
                 grouper \bioname{Epinephelus morio} in the U.S. Gulf of
                 Mexico, we demonstrate that in practice the approaches
                 to modeling discards can provide different outcomes,
                 with implications for the resultant management advice.
                 We conclude by comparing and contrasting the different
                 approaches, calling for more research to elucidate
                 which approach is most suitable under various sources
                 of error typically encountered in discard data.",

                 of Pomacea canaliculata, an edible freshwater snail, as
                 it is practiced by a farmer as mini-livestock in the
                 vicinity of Andong in Korea. We visited the snail farm
                 several times in the summer and winter of the year and
                 conducted interviews with the farm manager using a
                 semi-structured questionnaire. The farm is housed in
                 polythene tunnels and uses a tank pen of trench type
                 made up of propylene and measuring 1 m $ \times $ 2 m $
                 \times $ 0.5 m (length $ \times $ width $ \times $
                 height) in size. A regulated inflow of fresh water and
                 outflow of used water was installed, with water level
                 not exceeding 5 to 7 cm. As feed of snails, commercial
                 fish feed is generally provided. The life cycle of the
                 P. canaliculata might differ in captivity under the
                 controlled environmental conditions than that of an
                 individual in the wild environment. The farming system
                 of snails, particularly P. canaliculata, does not
                 involve high labor-intensive, high capital investment
                 and also does not require high through-put cutting edge
                 technology. In addition to providing nutrient-dense
                 snail meat, establishing a snailery could therefore
                 augment the economic condition of farmers in the poorer
                 regions of the world and encourage sustainability and

  abstract =     "The Chinese razor clam (\bioname{Sinonovacula
                 constricta}), a bivalve species widely distributed in
                 estuaries and mudflats, is often exposed to extreme
                 environmental and microbial stresses. Histones are
                 fundamental components of chromatin and play an
                 important role in innate immunity, as demonstrated by
                 its antimicrobial activities in clams. However, little
                 attention has been paid to histones in bivalves. To
                 fill this gap, we investigated the genomic
                 distribution, structural characteristics, conserved
                 motifs, and phylogenetic relationships of histones in
                 S. constricta. A total of 114 histone genes were
                 detected in the S. constricta genome, which were
                 divided into 25 types in phylogenetic analysis. Among
                 them, partial histones exhibited a tissue-dependent
                 expression pattern, indicating that they may be
                 involved in sustaining the homeostasis of
                 organs/tissues in adult S. constricta. Furthermore,
                 mRNA expression of certain histones changed
                 significantly in S. constricta when infected with
                 \bioname{Vibrio parahaemolyticus}, suggesting that
                 histones play a role in the immune defense of S.
                 constricta. All together, this study on histone genes
                 in S. constricta not only greatly expands our knowledge
                 of histone function in the clam, but also histone
                 evolution in molluscs.",

                 intracellular molecules involved in the function of the
                 immune system. Their secretion is induced by various
                 infectious stimuli. Cytokine release by host cells has
                 been extensively used as a powerful tool for studying
                 immune reactions in the early stages of viral and

                 human-induced pressures. In the marine realm, one of
                 the major threats to species conservation, together
                 with climate change, is overfishing. In this context,
                 having information on the conservation status of target
                 commercial marine fish species becomes crucial for
                 assuring safe standards. We put together fisheries
                 statistics from the FAO, the IUCN Red List, FishBase,
                 and RAM Legacy databases to understand to what extent
                 top commercial species' conservation status has been
                 assessed. Levels of assessment for top-fished species
                 were higher than those for general commercial or highly
                 commercial species, but almost half of the species have
                 outdated assessments. We found no relation between IUCN
                 Red List traits and FishBase Vulnerability Index,
                 depreciating the latter value as a guidance for
                 extinction threat. The RAM database suggests good
                 management of more-threatened species in recent
                 decades, but more data are required to assess whether
                 the trend has reverted in recent years. Outdated IUCN
                 Red List assessments can benefit from reputed stock
                 assessments for new reassessments. The future of IUCN
                 Red List evaluations for commercial fish species relies
                 on integrating new parameters from fisheries sources
                 and improved collaboration with fisheries stakeholders

                 not only efficient and time-saving, but also cause less
                 harm to monitoring targets. Environmental DNA has
                 become a common tool for the assessment and monitoring
                 of aquatic organisms. In this study, we investigated
                 fish resources in the Yangtze River mainstream using
                 environmental DNA, and the variations in fish during
                 two seasons (spring and autumn) were compared. The
                 results showed that 13 species were identified in
                 spring, and nine species of fish were identified in
                 autumn. The fish with higher eDNA detection were
                 Sinibotia superciliaris, \bioname{Tachysurus

                 variation between spring and autumn was not
                 significant, and the environmental factors had
                 different effects on fish assemblages during the two
                 seasons. Our study used the eDNA technique to monitor
                 the composition of fish in the spring and autumn in the
                 Yangtze River mainstream, providing a new technology
                 for the long-term management and protection of fishery
                 resources in the region. Of course, problems such as
                 pollution and insufficient databases are the current
                 shortcomings of environmental DNA, which will be the
                 focus of our future research and study.",

                 Adriatic Sea, as the northernmost region of the
                 Mediterranean. A total of 113 specimens (59 females, 53
                 males, and one individual of indeterminate sex),
                 ranging from 23.4 to 42.5 cm in total length, were
                 analyzed. The maximum observed age was 5 years for both
                 females and males, and this barracuda population was
                 dominated by 3 year old fish. Growth was described by
                 the von Bertalanffy growth curve (L {\infty} = 55.58

                 hatching rate, morphology score and body length.

                 analyzed the use of alizarin complexone (ALC) as a
                 fluorescent marker to mark the various hard structures
                 of juvenile silver carp. Experimental fish (~2 months
                 old) were randomly assigned to either control or
                 marking groups, which were immersed in 0 or 100 mg/L
                 ALC solutions, respectively, for 2 days. The otoliths,
                 fin rays, and scales of the fish were then sampled,
                 visualized using fluorescence microscopy, and evaluated
                 after 10 days. The ALC treatment was effective for
                 marking certain hard structures and the marking color
                 was affected by the light source. There were no obvious
                 differences in the marking efficiency of rays from
                 pectoral, dorsal, ventral, anal, and caudal fins, but
                 the lapilli and lateral line scales were marked most
                 effectively from the sampled otolith and scale types,
                 respectively. Our findings indicate that ALC immersion
                 and fin ray and scale sampling can be used for the

                 important role in physiological function. The study of
                 fish scale development mechanisms provides a basis for
                 exploring the molecular-level developmental differences
                 between scaled and non-scaled fishes. In this study,
                 alizarin red staining was used to divide the different
                 stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) scale development.
                 Four developmental stages, namely stage I (~17 dpf,
                 scales have not started to grow), stage II (~33 dpf,
                 the point at which scales start to grow), stage III
                 (~41 dpf, the period in which the scales almost cover
                 the whole body), and stage IV (~3 mpf, scales cover the
                 whole body), were determined and used for subsequent
                 transcriptome analysis. WGCNA (weighted correlation
                 network analysis) and DEG (differentially expressed
                 gene) analysis were used for screening the key genes.
                 Based on the comparison between stage II and stage I,
                 54 hub-genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. Key
                 genes including the Scpp family (Scpp7, Scpp6, Scpp5,
                 and Scpp8), the Fgf family (Fgfr1b and Fgfr3), Tcf7,
                 Wnt10b, Runx2b, and Il2rb were identified by DEG
                 analysis, which indicated that these genes played
                 important roles in the key nodes of scale development
                 signal pathways. Combined with this analysis, the
                 TGF-{\beta}, Wnt/{\beta}-catenin, and FGF signaling
                 pathways were suggested to be the most important signal
                 pathways for scales starting to grow. This study laid a
                 foundation for exploring the scale development
                 mechanism of other fishes. The scale development
                 candidate genes identified in the current study will

                 (0--144 h post-infection (hpi)) covered the early
                 stages of infection, with hematological, antioxidant
                 and immunological responses examined. Early activation
                 of the host's immune system was seen in the first few
                 hours post-infection (6 to 9 hpi), as evidenced by an
                 increase in tnf{\alpha}, cd28 and c3 expression in the

                 differences in the number of thrombocytes and various

                 in the liver showed significant differences over the

                 tnf{\alpha} and il-1{\beta} coincided with the
                 appearance of disease symptoms, peak levels of virus in

                 the early interactions between European seabass and
                 Betanodavirus to establish early indicators of
                 infection to prevent more severe outcomes of the

                 from eggs immediately after fertilization to hatching.
                 The protein levels in the eggs gradually increased with
                 development until the completion of hatching. In
                 contrast, the triglyceride (TG) and free amino acid

                 although the energy composition of the FAAs was lower
                 than that of the TGs throughout embryonic development.
                 These results indicate that endogenous TGs are

                 hatching, when they rapidly increased. This rapid
                 increase was consistent with the protein content,
                 suggesting that organ differentiation and
                 functionalization were promoted during this period.

                 was cloned from cobia (Rachycentron canadum) using the

                 protein family, 7 RGG repeats, and 10 RG repeats in the
                 N-terminal region. Comparisons of the deduced amino

                 addition, annual changes in Rcvasa expression levels
                 were examined in the gonads by quantitative real-time
                 PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of Rcvasa in the testis
                 first increased significantly at 120 dph (stage
                 II--III), then stabilized as the testis developed from
                 185 dph (stage III) to 360 dph (stage V). During the
                 development of the ovary (stage I to II), the
                 expression of Rcvasa first increased and reached the
                 highest level at 210 dph (stage II), then decreased.
                 Furthermore, the results of chromogenic in situ
                 hybridization (CISH) revealed that Rcvasa mRNA was
                 mainly expressed in germ cells and barely detected in
                 somatic cells. In the testis, Rcvasa mRNA signal was
                 concentrated in the periphery of spermatogonia, primary
                 spermatocytes, and secondary spermatocytes and was
                 significantly weaker in spermatids and spermatozoa. In
                 the ovary, Rcvasa mRNA signal was uniformly distributed
                 in the perinuclear cytoplasm and was intense in early
                 primary oocytes (stage I and II). These findings could
                 provide a reference for understanding the regulatory
                 mechanisms of vasa expression during the development of
                 germ cells in cobia.",

                 stress-related gene expressions. Four isolipidic diets:
                 two fishmeal-based (FM) and two plant feedstuff
                 (PF)-based diets, with P/CH ratios of 50/10 or 40/20
                 each (FM-P50/CH10; FM-P40/CH20; PF-P50/CH10;
                 PF-P40/CH20), were tested. PF-based diets lead to more
                 histomorphological alterations than FM-based diets.
                 P/CH ratio had no relevant effect on gut
                 histomorphology. Gut mucosa of fish fed PF-based diets
                 presented a higher number of operational taxonomic
                 units, and richness and diversity indices, while the
                 P/CH ratio did not affect those parameters. The
                 {\alpha}-amylase activity was lower in fish fed with
                 PF-based diets and in fish fed the P40/CH20 diets.
                 Regarding the immune-related genes, only
                 cyclooxygenase-2 was affected, being higher in fish fed
                 the P50/CH10 diets than the P40/CH20 diets. Fish fed
                 the FM-based diets presented higher expression of

                 fish fed the P50/CH10 diet had higher expression of
                 superoxide dismutase. In conclusion, PF-based diets can
                 compromise gut absorptive and digestive metabolism, but
                 decreasing the dietary P/CH ratio had little effect on

                 species recorded in the Adriatic is 449. The Adriatic
                 has 58.8\% of Mediterranean species richness, 76.1\% of
                 its families, and 87.8\% of its orders. Among species
                 discovered in the Adriatic after 2010, twelve species
                 were attributed to biological invasion, mostly Atlantic
                 immigrants or alien species, and ten species were
                 attributed to improved research on the native
                 ichthyofauna of the Adriatic area. About 58\% of
                 species are native species of Atlanto-Mediterranean
                 origin, 21\% are native species of wider global
                 occurrence, 15\% are Mediterranean or Mediterranean and
                 Black Sea endemics and 5\% originated outside
                 Mediterranean Sea. The majority of species inhabit the
                 benthic environment (71.9\%), while others occur in the
                 pelagic environment (20.7\%) or are euryhaline (7.3\%).
                 The benthic littoral species are the most numerous
                 Adriatic fishes, representing 40\% of all species
                 richness, whereas pelagic fishes are mainly eurybathic
                 or epipelagic; only 3.6\% of species are deep pelagic
                 species. A Red Book of marine fishes of the Adriatic
                 Sea is urgently needed to assess their conservation

                 from laboratory-reared larval and juvenile
                 Sinogastromyzon wui (S. wui, 0 to 25 days
                 post-hatching) that were obtained as eggs from the
                 Shilong Reach of Xijiang River between April and August

                 otoliths (lapilli, sagittae, and asterisci) and
                 compared the shape changes and growth of the lapilli
                 and sagittae, as well as the timing and deposition rate
                 of increments of the lapilli. The lapilli and the
                 sagittae were visible on hatching, whereas the
                 asterisci were present at four days post-hatching
                 (dph). The shape of the sagitta changed more obviously
                 than that of the lapillus, and a strong correlation was
                 observed between sagitta shape changes and fish
                 ontogenesis. The otolith shape greatly modulated during
                 the post-flexion larval stage (Post-FLS), it
                 corresponded with the formation period of individual
                 fins. Analysis of the microstructural features

                 age and the number of lapillus daily increments, we
                 demonstrated that the lapillus developmental increments
                 were deposited daily, and the first increment formed at
                 two days post-hatching. Our conclusions support
                 employing the lapillus increment deposition rate and

  abstract =     "In recent years, much attention has been focused on
                 the impact of climate change, particularly via ocean
                 acidification (OA), on marine organisms. Studying the
                 impact of OA on long-living organisms, such as sharks,
                 is especially challenging. When the ocean waters absorb
                 anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2), slow-growing shark
                 species with long generation times may be subjected to
                 stress, leading to a decrease in functionality. Our
                 goal was to examine the behavioral and physiological
                 responses of sharks to OA and the possible impacts on
                 their fitness and resilience. We conducted a systematic
                 review in line with PRISMA-Analyses, of previously
                 reported scientific experiments. We found that most
                 studies used CO 2 partial pressures (pCO 2) that
                 reflect representative concentration pathways for the
                 year 2100 (e.g., pH ~7.8, pCO 2 ~1000 {\mu}atm). Since
                 there is a considerable knowledge gap on the effect of
                 OA on sharks, we utilized existing data on bony fish to
                 synthesize the available knowledge. Given the
                 similarities between the behaviors and physiology of
                 these two superclasses' to changes in CO 2 and pH
                 levels, there is merit in including the available
                 information on bony fish as well. Several studies
                 indicated a decrease in shark fitness in relation to
                 increased OA and CO 2 levels. However, the decrease was
                 species-specific and influenced by the intensity of the
                 change in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and other
                 anthropogenic and environmental factors (e.g., fishing,
                 temperature). Most studies involved only limited
                 exposure to future environmental conditions and were
                 conducted on benthic shark species studied in the
                 laboratory rather than on apex predator species. While
                 knowledge gaps exist, and more research is required, we
                 conclude that anthropogenic factors are likely
                 contributing to shark species' vulnerability worldwide.
                 However, the impact of OA on the long-term stability of
                 shark populations is not unequivocal.",

                 faecium and studied the effects of replacing fish meal
                 with different proportions of FSM on serum antioxidant
                 indices and gut microbiota (GM) composition of crucian
                 carp (Carassius auratus). Our results showed that the
                 co-fermentation of soybean meal was the most effective
                 when the ratio of B. subtilis X-2 and E. faecium X-4
                 was 2:3, glucose addition was 4.5\%, KH 2 PO 4 addition
                 was 0.15\%, MgSO 4 {\cdot}7H 2 O addition was 0.1\%,
                 anhydrous sodium acetate addition was 0.4\%,
                 fermentation time was 120 h, and the solid--water ratio
                 was 1:1. Replacing 40\% fish meal with FSM in the feed
                 significantly improved the serum T-AOC, POD, and IgM
                 levels in C. auratus. Although there were significant
                 differences in the midgut and hindgut microbiota
                 structures of C. auratus, the addition of FSM to the
                 feed did not cause significant differences in the GM
                 structure, whether in the midgut or hindgut. Therefore,
                 40\% FSM is the most suitable substitute for fish meal
                 in the feed of C. auratus.",

                 activities. A total of 208,121 specimens and 1281
                 trawls were studied throughout the course of 13 years
                 of shrimp size composition. To investigate differences
                 in length composition between fishing grounds, months,
                 and depth, a PERMANOVA analysis was employed. A
                 geographic information system was developed for
                 environmental characterisation and spatiotemporal trawl
                 fleet distribution. Our findings show that the
                 industrial trawl shrimp fleet has a close relationship

                 locations, and depths during different stages of their

                 cohorts. The management measures of limiting effort
                 (number of vessels) appear enough to avoid
                 overcapitalisation, but the closed period and a
                 proposed no-take fishing zone appear insufficient for
                 what was originally proposed. Ecosystem-based
                 management strategies should be addressed immediately
                 because they would be far more effective than
                 traditional fishery-based management measures in

                 immunological role of HSPs from Schizothorax prenanti (
                 S . prenanti), Sp HSP60 was cloned for the first time
                 in this study, and the gene expressions of Sp HSP27, Sp
                 HSP60, Sp HSP70 and Sp HSP90 in the hepatopancreas,
                 head kidney, hindgut and spleen were analyzed by
                 quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) after treatment with
                 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The open reading frame of the
                 Sp HSP60 gene (GenBank accession number ON245159) is
                 1728 bp. It encodes a protein of 575 amino acids. Its
                 C-terminus is a highly conserved and repeated glycine
                 sequence, which is an important cofactor in ATP
                 binding. Compared with the control group, most of the
                 Sp HSPs were significantly upregulated in the tissues
                 examined at 12 or 24 h after LPS challenge. The most
                 abundant expression of Sp HSP70 was found in the head
                 kidney at 24 h after LPS injection, followed by Sp
                 HSP27 in the spleen at 24 h; both of these Sp HSPs
                 displayed strong expression under the LPS stresses,
                 about 20--70 fold more than that of Sp HSP60 and Sp
                 HSP90. The temporal expression patterns of the four Sp
                 HSP genes were different in the four tissues examined.
                 Taken together, the results suggest that Sp HSP27, Sp
                 HSP60, Sp HSP70 and Sp HSP90 participate in innate
                 immunity stimulated by LPS, and the response intensity
                 of the Sp HSPs was organ-specific, indicating they
                 could provide early warning information against
                 bacterial infection. The findings in our study will
                 contribute to better understanding the biological
                 processes and important roles of Sp HSPs involved in
                 defending against pathogenic bacterial challenge.",

                 In addition, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 g kg {$-$1} FOS promoted
                 the downregulation of the claudin-15 gene expression (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). At the same time, FOS inclusion did not
                 increase the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 expression.
                 We can conclude that 7.5 g kg {$-$1} FOS
                 supplementation improves growth performance, survival
                 rate, and digestive capacity, and could contribute to
                 the reinforcement of the intestinal barrier function of
                 Tropical gar larvae.",

  abstract =     "Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays), which have peculiar
                 and vulnerable life-history traits, are highly
                 threatened by fishing activities. Indeed, between 53\%
                 and 71\% of Mediterranean elasmobranch species are at
                 risk of extinction. In this context, using the
                 abundance MSY (AMSY) model, the present study provides
                 an assessment of 20 batoids and 16 shark species in the
                 Strait of Sicily, sampled during a bottom trawl survey
                 from 1995 to 2020. Overall, the outputs underline a
                 progressively improving condition for shark and ray
                 assemblages of both shelf and eurybathic zones. As for
                 slope-dwelling species, a horseshoe-shaped dynamic,
                 characterized by a progressive decrease in relative
                 harvesting pressure and an increase in relative biomass
                 followed by an increase in fishing pressure and
                 decrease in biomass, was detected. The dynamics of the
                 Elasmobranchii living in the Strait of Sicily appear to
                 be affected by changes in the fishing patterns of
                 trawlers, showing a shift from shallow water to bathyal
                 fishing grounds and targeting deep-water red shrimp. In
                 this context, it seems wise to limit the impact of
                 deep-water fisheries on Elasmobranchii by reducing
                 fishing efforts and implementing ad hoc management
                 measures aimed at safeguarding these vulnerable
                 species.",

  abstract =     "Given the European eel population's marked decrease
                 since the 1980s, it has become urgent to collect
                 information describing its regional population
                 structure to improve management plans. The Minho River
                 (NW-Portugal, SW-Europe) is an important basin for the
                 eel at the southern limit of its distribution, but the
                 species is poorly described. Thus, we aimed to study
                 the structure of the European eel population in the
                 Minho River using otolith shape analysis, which has
                 proven to be effective in discriminating fish groups
                 experiencing different environmental conditions through
                 ontogeny. Our results showed complete discrimination
                 between the two main types of habitats studied
                 (tributaries and estuaries). Otoliths of eels from the
                 estuary were rectangular and elliptic, whereas in the
                 tributaries they presented a more round and circular
                 form. Eels collected in both habitats were mostly
                 yellow-stage eels with a similar age range, but the
                 eels from the tributaries showed smaller length-at-age
                 and lower body condition than those collected in the
                 estuary. Additionally, the sex ratio was skewed towards
                 males in the tributaries and females in the estuary.
                 This study reveals that there are at least two distinct
                 groups of eels in this basin, likely with different
                 development characteristics.",

                 antibacterial activity, which was potentiated by the
                 nanoemulsion. CCEO showed satisfactory anesthetic
                 activity in silver catfish, and its nanoemulsion
                 intensified the sedative activity. Supplementation of
                 1.0 mL CCEO per kg of diet for 60 days increased
                 weight, length, and weight gain when compared to the
                 control group, evidencing the growth-promoting activity
                 of this EO. Dietary supplementation of CCEO for 30 and
                 60 days also showed an antioxidant effect, as it
                 decreased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive
                 species and increased the superoxide dismutase activity
                 in the liver of silver catfish. Therefore, cinnamon EOs

                 significantly to the livelihoods and food security of
                 millions of people within the region. However,
                 freshwater fisheries are experiencing multiple
                 anthropogenic stressors such as overfishing, illegal

                 climate change on freshwater fisheries in Sub-Saharan
                 Africa. This study reviews the existing literature and
                 highlights the effects of climate change on freshwater
                 fisheries, the adaptation strategies of
                 fishery-dependent households in response to the
                 effects, and fisheries' management and mitigation
                 efforts in the face of climate change. The general
                 effects of climate change on freshwater environments
                 include warming water temperatures, increased
                 stratification, modified hydrological processes, and

                 the physiological processes of fish and the overall
                 wellbeing of fishery-dependent people. To cope with the
                 effects of fluctuating fishery resources due to climate
                 change, fishery-dependent people have adopted several
                 adaptation strategies including livelihood
                 diversification, changing their fishing gear,
                 increasing their fishing efforts, and targeting new
                 species. Several management attempts have been made to
                 enhance the sustainability of fishery resources, from
                 local to regional levels. This study recommends the

                 animals; however, there are only a few reports on role
                 of XCR1 in the immune system of fish. We aimed to
                 analyze the expression of XCR1 in various organs or
                 tissues of grass carp before and after Grass Carp
                 Reovirus (GCRV) infection to better understand the
                 function of XCR1 in resistance to GCRV infection. We
                 cloned and sequenced the cDNA of grass carp XCR1 and
                 analyzed the molecular structure of XCR1 based its
                 amino acid sequence. Further, we analyzed the relative
                 expression levels of XCR1 in different organs or
                 tissues of male parent grass carp with GCRV resistance
                 (P1) and their first-generation offspring (F1) before
                 and after GCRV infection. Our results show that the
                 total length of cDNA of the grass carp XCR1 gene is
                 1659 bp and encodes 365 amino acids. XCR1 contains
                 seven conserved transmembrane helical domains. The
                 homologous tertiary structure of XCR1 is similar to its
                 homologs in other species. After artificial GCRV
                 infection, there were significant differences in the
                 expression of the grass carp XCR1 gene in different
                 tissues, at different time points, and between P1 and
                 F1 fish. These results will contribute to our
                 understanding of the role of XCR1 in fish immune
                 responses and contribute to the development of
                 GCRV-resistant grass carp.",

  abstract =     "Four members of the miR-200 family in Japanese
                 flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) have sex-biased
                 expression patterns, but their target genes and how
                 they work in the development of the gonads are rarely
                 known. Anti-M{\"u}llerian hormone (AMH) can inhibit the
                 development of Muller's duct in female mammals and
                 regulate the formation of gametes after sexual
                 maturity. There is no Muller's duct in teleosts, but
                 the amh gene still exists. Knockout of amh results in
                 sex reversal from male to female. Therefore, it is
                 essential to explore the relationship between the
                 miR-200 family and amh to clarify what role miR-200
                 plays in the development of the gonads. In Japanese
                 flounder, the two binding sites for the miR-200 family
                 in the 3{\prime}UTR of amh were found through
                 bioinformatic prediction. Double luciferase and green
                 fluorescent protein reporter experiments demonstrated
                 amh to be directly targeted by miR-200a and miR-200b.
                 Moreover, miR-200a and miR-200b reduced the expression
                 of amh through site 1 rather than site 2. To explore
                 the regulatory role of miR-200a in gonadal development,
                 we further overexpressed miR-200a in the primary
                 Sertoli cells of the testis. With the overexpression of
                 miR-200a, the expression of amh decreased, while the
                 expression of the other two male sex-related genes,
                 dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor
                 1) and gsdf (diagonal soma driven factor), increased
                 significantly. This result indicates that the miR-200
                 family regulates the gonadal differentiation and
                 development by targeting amh in Japanese flounder.",

                 The expression of zo-2 was higher with the 6 g kg

                 global spread via frozen shrimp in the shrimp trade is

                 transmission; thus, the infectivity of frozen shrimp

                 prepare infected frozen shrimp, 12 Penaeus vannamei
                 (average weight, 2 g) were exposed to Vp AHPND by

                 shrimp were stored at {$-$80} {$^\circ $}C for further
                 analysis. After two weeks, a PCR assay was used to
                 confirm AHPND positivity in frozen shrimp (n = 2), and
                 Vp AHPND was reisolated from the hepatopancreases of
                 these shrimp. For the infectivity test, 10 P. vannamei
                 (average weight, 4 g) were fed with the
                 hepatopancreases of Vp AHPND -infected frozen shrimp (
                 n = 10). After feeding, 70\% of the shrimp died within
                 118 h, and the presence of Vp AHPND was confirmed using
                 a PCR assay and histopathology examination; moreover,
                 Vp AHPND was successfully reisolated from the

                 demersal fish species, and percentage of

                 diet, percentage of pelagic species, and percentage of
                 the dominant species. The dominant species varied
                 greatly over the 50 year period and showed a tendency
                 towards small-sized species. The synthetic F-IBI
                 variable showed a downward trend and has indicated a
                 `fair' state since 1998. The decline in the F-IBI over
                 the last three decades suggests that anthropogenic
                 disturbances, especially overfishing, have had a
                 serious impact on the fish community of the Beibu Gulf.
                 The F-IBI is currently at risk of becoming `poor.'
                 Consequently, we suggest that rigid and enforceable
                 fishery management measures should be taken by both
                 China and Vietnam to prevent further deterioration of
                 the fisheries' resources in the gulf.",

  abstract =     "The WAC Bennett Dam was completed in 1968 and
                 impounded the Upper Peace River to form the Williston
                 Reservoir in north central British Columbia. In 1990,
                 an enhancement project was initiated to stock Columbia
                 River Kokanee (non-anadromous Sockeye Salmon;
                 Oncorhynchus nerka) from southeastern British Columbia
                 into tributary streams that drained into regions of the
                 reservoir that were accessible by anglers. The current
                 distribution of spawning Columbia-origin Kokanee in the
                 Williston Reservoir watershed, however, does not
                 reflect the locations where these fish were initially
                 stocked and suggests extensive straying. Whether or not
                 Kokanee will develop fidelity to specific spawning
                 locations is not known, but it is important information
                 to effectively manage these introduced fish. We used
                 otolith microchemistry to estimate fidelity to natal
                 streams by Columbia-origin Kokanee in the Williston
                 Reservoir. Otolith elemental signatures for the region
                 of the otolith that formed during the larval period and
                 characterized the natal redd environment showed
                 considerable variation among samples. Natal signatures
                 tended to cluster for each river but not for all
                 spawners, suggesting elemental signatures from other
                 rivers. Homing to one of the four natal streams we
                 examined was classified to be 73\% based on linear
                 discriminant analysis, although variation in the
                 elemental signatures within each group suggests that
                 homing by Kokanee to specific natal streams may be as
                 low as 55\%. Based on similarity of water elemental
                 signatures for tributaries within large rivers,
                 however, the proportion of fish that returned to their
                 general region was likely higher and estimated to be
                 approximately 83\%. The result of regional homing could
                 be reproductive isolation and adaptation to local
                 conditions. It is unclear, however, if the current
                 estimated level of straying will limit genetic
                 differentiation and prevent local adaptation.",

  abstract =     "Every year, marine scientists around the world read
                 thousands of otolith or scale images to determine the
                 age structure of commercial fish stocks. This knowledge
                 is important for fisheries and conservation management.
                 However, the age-reading procedure is time-consuming
                 and costly to perform due to the specialized expertise
                 and labor needed to identify annual growth zones in
                 otoliths. Effective automated systems are needed to
                 increase throughput and reduce cost. DeepOtolith is an
                 open-source artificial intelligence (AI) platform that
                 addresses this issue by providing a web system with a
                 simple interface that automatically estimates fish age
                 by combining otolith images with convolutional neural
                 networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks that
                 has been a dominant method in computer vision tasks.
                 Users can upload otolith image data for selective fish
                 species, and the platform returns age estimates. The
                 estimates of multiple images can be exported to conduct
                 conclusions or further age-related research.
                 DeepOtolith currently contains classifiers/regressors
                 for three fish species; however, more species will be
                 included as related work on ageing will be tested and
                 published soon. Herein, the architecture and
                 functionality of the platform are presented. Current
                 limitations and future directions are also discussed.
                 Overall, DeepOtolith should be considered as the first
                 step towards building a community of marine ecologists,
                 machine learning experts, and stakeholders that will
                 collaborate to support the conservation of fishery

                 abnormal hermaphroditism in Galeus melastomus
                 (Rafinesque, 1810). The black mouth cat shark specimen,
                 collected in summer from southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the
                 entrance of Salerno gulf, showed a basic intersexuality
                 characterized by the presence of male secondary and
                 female primary sexual characters. The reproductive
                 system has been described with an accurate
                 morphological analysis, also including a histological
                 assessment of oocytes. Results showed the presence of
                 only right clasper, not exceeding the pelvic fin in
                 length, with the absence of internal males' sexual
                 organs. Concerning the female primary characters, the
                 analysis of histological assessment showed the
                 structure of mature oocyte, confirming the maturity
                 stage of a mature female in active extruding stage, as

                 diets was significantly higher than those that could
                 not. After feeding with high-carbohydrate artificial
                 diets, the expression of penk mRNA showed no
                 significant difference between mandarin fish with
                 hypophagia and those that still ate normally. A total
                 of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) loci
                 related to easy domestication toward eating artificial
                 diets were screened from the mandarin fish population.
                 Additionally, the TT genotype at one of the loci was
                 significantly correlated with the food habit
                 domestication of mandarin fish.",

                 impacts are major challenges in regard to addressing
                 future climate hazards in Taiwan. Taiwan's geographic

                 which is an important primary industry and a source of

                 events occur, is a critical period for fish. However,
                 research on the early development of clearhead icefish
                 is very limited, especially in molecular research. In
                 this study, we aimed to explore the dynamic changes in
                 the biological functions of five key periods in
                 clearhead icefish early development, namely the YL
                 (embryonic), PM (first day after hatching), KK (fourth
                 day after hatching), LC (seventh day after hatching),
                 and SL (tenth day after hatching) stages, through
                 transcriptome sequencing and different analysis
                 strategies. A trend expression analysis and an
                 enrichment analysis revealed that the expression
                 ofgenes encoding G protein-coupled receptors and their
                 ligands, i.e., prss1_2_3, pomc, npy, npb, sst, rln3,
                 crh, gh, and prl that are associated with digestion and
                 feeding regulation gradually increased during early
                 development. In addition, a weighted gene co-expression
                 network analysis (WGCNA) showed that eleven modules
                 were significantly associated with early development,
                 among which nine modules were significantly positively
                 correlated. Through the enrichment analysis and hub
                 gene identification results of these nine modules, it
                 was found that the pathways related to eye, bone, and
                 heart development were significantly enriched in the YL
                 stage, and the ccnd2, seh1l, kdm6a, arf4, and ankrd28
                 genes that are associated with cell proliferation and
                 differentiation played important roles in these
                 developmental processes; the pak3, dlx3, dgat2, and
                 tas1r1 genes that are associated with jaw and tooth
                 development, TG (triacylglycerol) synthesis, and umami
                 amino acid receptors were identified as hub genes for
                 the PM stage; the pathways associated with aerobic
                 metabolism and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis were
                 significantly enriched in the KK stage, with the foxk,
                 slc13a2_3_5, ndufa5, and lsc2 genes playing important
                 roles; the pathways related to visual perception were
                 significantly enriched in the LC stage; and the bile
                 acid biosynthetic and serine-type peptidase activity
                 pathways were significantly enriched in the SL stage.
                 These results provide a more detailed understanding of

  abstract =     "Although the GDP of the fishery sector accounts for
                 less than 0.3\% of Taiwan's GDP, there are many
                 secondary and tertiary industries related to fisheries
                 that add great value to the country's economy.
                 Therefore, when analyzing and calculating the output
                 value and value added of the fishery sector, the
                 relevance of these upstream and downstream industries
                 should be considered jointly, and the value chain of
                 the fishery industry should be studied and analyzed in
                 order to truly present the value added created by
                 fishery. This study aims to do this by first analyzing
                 not only the primary fishery industry, but the value
                 chain of the fishery industry at different stages such
                 as fishery production, marine fishing, aquaculture,
                 fishery processing, retail and services, and supportive
                 systems. Then the value added of the whole fishery
                 value chain to Taiwan's GDP is estimated by using the
                 Leontief input--output model, from the perspective of
                 industry linkages and covering the period from 2011 to
                 2018. The empirical results suggest that the value
                 added created by fishery and related industries
                 accounted for 2.96\% of the GDP in 2011, which rose to
                 3.11\% in 2014, fell to 2.87\% in 2015, rose to 2.93\%
                 in 2017, and fell to 2.84\% in 2018. From 2011 to 2018,
                 the amount of value added created by fisheries and
                 related industries rose from NT$ 422.8 b i l l i o n t
                 o N T $ 520.9 billion. The primary fishery sector has
                 the largest contribution, followed by the fishery input
                 sector, and transportation and sale service sector, and
                 the fishery product processing sector has the lowest
                 contribution rate. The empirical results provide

                 was to produce phenazine compounds from FBPs via
                 microbial fermentation and assess their novel
                 antinematode effect. Among various FBPs, squid pen
                 powder (SPP) was discovered as the most suitable
                 substrate for phenazine production by Pseudomonas
                 aeruginosa TUN03 fermentation. Various small-scale
                 experiments conducted in flasks for phenazine
                 production indicated that the most suitable was the
                 newly designed liquid medium which included 1\% SPP,
                 0.05\% MgSO 4, and 0.1\% Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 (initial pH 7).
                 Phenazines were further studied for scale-up
                 bioproduction in a 14 L bioreactor system resulting in
                 a high yield (22.73 {\SGMLmicro}g/mL) in a much shorter
                 cultivation time (12 h). In the fermented culture
                 broth, hemi-pyocyanin (HPC) was detected as a major
                 phenazine compound with an area percentage of 11.28\%
                 in the crude sample. In the bioactivity tests, crude
                 phenazines and HPC demonstrate novel potential
                 nematicidal activity against black pepper nematodes,
                 inhibiting both juveniles (J2) nematodes and egg
                 hatching. The results of this work suggest a novel use
                 of SPP for cost-effective bioproduction of HPC, a novel
                 potential nematodes inhibitor. Moreover, the
                 combination of MgSO 4 and Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 was also found
                 to be a novel salt composition that significantly

                 pathogen in intensive Nile tilapia production, causing
                 high mortality rates and great economic losses. This
                 work aimed to evaluate the Nile tilapia vaccination
                 against S. agalactiae and fed with ration containing
                 probiotic AQUA PHOTO {\reg} composed of Bacillus
                 subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum, on the immune
                 response action and gut microbiota. The experimental
                 design was completely randomized with five treatments
                 (CON = control; ADJ = adjuvant; PRO = probiotic; VAC =
                 vaccine; PRO + VAC = probiotic + vaccine) and five
                 replicates. The vaccine (bacterin + adjuvant) was
                 injected after 21 days (21d) of probiotic feeding and
                 the vaccine was booster 14 days post-vaccination (35d).
                 After 14 days of the booster (49d), the fish were
                 challenged with S. agalactiae and observed for more
                 than 14 days, completing 63 days. The immunized group
                 showed a better survival rate (CON 40\%; ADJ 57\%; PRO
                 67\%; VAC 87\%; PRO + VAC 97\%). The treatments VAC and
                 PRO + VAC, after booster produced higher levels of IgM
                 antibodies compared with the control from the same
                 time. The combination of probiotic and vaccination
                 provided better protection against S. agalactiae
                 infection, directly affecting the gut microbiological
                 profile. These results indicated the contribution of
                 probiotic to the adaptive immune response through the
                 modulation of the intestinal microbiota, improving the
                 effect of the vaccination. In conclusion, AQUA PHOTO
                 {\reg}, composed of B. subtilis and L. plantarum,
                 orally administered to Nile tilapia vaccinated against
                 and challenged with S. agalactiae increases protection
                 from infection and modifies the intestinal microbiota
                 profile of the host, promoting the microbiota balance
                 and improving adaptive immune response.",

                 community in the Adriatic Sea, but knowledge about its
                 feeding ecology is scarce. The aim of this paper is to
                 present new evidence about its food preferences and
                 feeding habits. An innovative non-destructive method of
                 fecal pellet analysis was used for this study. This
                 method does not require sacrificing specimens and the
                 fish can be released back into the sea alive after the
                 laboratory work. The results demonstrated that S.
                 scriba mainly preys on decapods, followed by
                 polychaetes, isopods, fish, mollusks and swarming
                 shrimps. The calculated index of trophic diversity
                 (ITD) value of 0.89 indicates that it is an
                 opportunistic feeder that feeds on a wide range of
                 different prey. According to the calculated trophic
                 level of 3.43, which is higher than that of other
                 members of the community, S. scriba is also an
                 important piscivorous predator. With age, S. scriba
                 undergoes an ontogenetic shift. The proportion of
                 crustaceans, gastropods and polychaetes decreases with
                 age and body size, while the proportion of fish

                 spawning with three spawning peaks. The daily growth
                 analysis was performed in otoliths of adult females on
                 the transversal section of the sagittae otolith. Daily
                 increments were measured from the border to the nucleus

                 that daily growth of females decreases during the

                 somatic growth in favor of the production of gametes,
                 with an increase in growth in July. Lastly, daily
                 growth individual trends showed a ``spawning pattern''
                 in 28\% of medium and large females, suggesting an
                 individual spawning period of one to two months, with
                 4--5 valleys of narrow daily increments, likely
                 associated to batch release: individual spawning
                 frequency would be 4--5 days. This is the first time
                 that individual spawning frequency in hake is estimated
                 based on individual data. Finally, the spawning pattern
                 is detected only once per year, indicating that a
                 single female participates only in one spawning peak
                 per year, supporting the hypothesis of the existence of

                 sinensis in the control group was normal. With
                 increasing alkalinity, the basal membrane of the
                 hepatopancreas fell off or even ruptured. Additionally,
                 the number of hepatopancreas vacuoles increased, the
                 volume of B cells and their internal transport vesicles
                 increased, epithelial cells disintegrated, and the
                 nucleus gradually shrank. E. sinensis can activate
                 antioxidant and nonspecific immune systems to adapt to
                 alkalinity stress. However, oxidative stress, immune
                 system damage and hepatopancreas structure damage were
                 caused when the stress exceeded the adaptive capacity
                 of the body.",

  abstract =     "Globally, over 85\% of oyster reefs have been lost,
                 and the combined effects of climate change, ocean
                 acidification, and environmental degradation, including
                 pollution and mangrove overharvesting, could further
                 reduce global oyster fisheries in the coming decades.
                 To understand the level of impact of climate change on
                 the oyster fishery in West Africa, an expert-based
                 vulnerability assessment to climate change was
                 conducted for the West African mangrove oyster
                 (Crassostrea tulipa, Lamarck 1819). Using a combination
                 of the exposure of the oyster to climatic stressors
                 (estuarine temperature, salinity, river flow, surface
                 run-off, sea level rise, and estuarine circulation)
                 together with an assessment of sensitivity to these
                 stressors, we estimate the overall vulnerability of C.
                 tulipa to climate change. A very high overall climate
                 vulnerability score of 12 on a scale of 16 was
                 calculated for C. tulipa. While the overall climate
                 exposure score in the West African coastal region
                 remained high, the high sensitivity of C. tulipa to
                 hydrographic conditions of its habitat, in particular
                 salinity, coupled with its sessile and habitat-specific
                 nature, pushed the overall vulnerability to very high.
                 Early life history settlement requirements, adult
                 mobility, and sensitivity to salinity were the three
                 most important biological and sensitivity attributes
                 that determined the vulnerability score. By leaving
                 each of these three sensitivity attributes out of the
                 analysis, the overall vulnerability score was reduced
                 to 9 (i.e., from very high to high). A negative
                 directional effect of climate change, coupled with a
                 low potential for change in distribution, threatens the
                 C. tulipa fishery in a long-term adverse climate
                 scenario. We recommend management efforts that
                 incorporate climate resilience and adaptation practices
                 to prioritize recruitment success, as well as the
                 development of breeding lines with climate-resilient
                 traits.",

                 at different time scales (daily, weekly, monthly,

                 its schools can improve conservation actions and
                 fishery management, along with the operation of the
                 fleets targeting E. ringens. There is an important
                 fishery of E. ringens in Northern Chile ({18$^\circ
                 $}21{\prime} S--{26$^\circ $}00{\prime} S), which

                 identify and predict potential fishing grounds for E.
                 ringens in this system, we implemented a predictive
                 model of fishing grounds based on neural networks,
                 which was trained with the georeferenced data of daily
                 catches by industrial purse sein ships from 2003 to
                 2020 and information on oceanographic variables (sea

                 Copernicus Marine Enviroment Monitoring Service (CMEMS
                 program). The neural network model had a very good
                 performance (86\%). Longitude (23\%) was the most
                 relevant variable for identifying potential fishing
                 grounds, followed by the mixed layer depth (18\%),
                 latitude (15\%), sea surface temperature (12\%), month
                 (12\%), sea height (9\%), salinity (9\%), and the zonal
                 and meridional components of the current velocity

                 feed 360 fish (initial weight 43.78 {\pm} 0.12 g) with
                 graded protein levels (26.45\%, 29.28\%, 31.69\%,
                 33.68\%, 36.18\%, and 38.75\% dry matter). The results
                 showed that 26.45\% dietary protein significantly
                 improved glycolysis by increasing PK mRNA levels, while
                 the 29.28\% and 31.69\% dietary protein levels promoted
                 gluconeogenesis by increasing PEPCK and G6Pase mRNA
                 levels. For lipid metabolism, 26.45\% dietary protein
                 enhanced lipid synthesis by increasing PPAR-{\gamma},
                 SREBP1c, and FAS mRNA levels, while 31.69\% dietary
                 protein enhanced the level of lipolysis by increasing

                 plasma TG and TC contents were observed in the 29.28\%
                 and 31.69\% dietary protein groups, respectively. In
                 terms of antioxidants and immunity, the 31.69\% dietary
                 protein level activated the expression levels of HSP90
                 mRNA, thus increasing the expression levels of
                 antioxidant-related genes (CAT, SOD, and GPx), and
                 upregulating the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 mRNA
                 levels. In addition, regarding the antioxidant enzymes,
                 the highest GSH content was found in the 29.28\%
                 dietary protein group, while the 31.69\% dietary

                 time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to
                 accidents. Deep learning (DL) technology is rapidly
                 gaining popularity in various fields, including

                 necessitates the precise and accurate identification of
                 fish biodiversity. Observing fish behavior in real time
                 is imperative to make better feeding decisions. The
                 proposed study consists of an efficient end-to-end
                 convolutional neural network (CNN) classifying fish
                 behavior into the normal and starvation categories. The
                 performance of the CNN is evaluated by varying the
                 number of fully connected (FC) layers with or without
                 applying max-pooling operation. The accuracy of the
                 detection algorithm is increased by 10\% by
                 incorporating three FC layers and max pooling
                 operation. The results demonstrated that the shallow

                 observations, were collected and analyzed. The results
                 are as follows: (1) Cimei faces great threats in
                 social, economic, and environmental aspects, which has
                 led to Cimei Islands' promotion of permanent
                 development. (2) The current development of Cimei
                 cannot effectively drive industrial development or the
                 transformation of fishing villages. However, residents
                 are worried that overdevelopment will impact the
                 ecological environment and lifestyle on the Islands.
                 (3) Cimei's sustainable tourism development approach
                 should be to first take inventory of the ecological
                 environment and cultural resources, plan related
                 environmental laws and regulations, and finally, use
                 sustainable tourism to drive industrial development to
                 carry out island development.",

                 fish are affected by foreign substances. Therefore,
                 fish need a certain adaptation period to eliminate the
                 stress response. Herein, in order to determine the
                 adaptation period, the bionic robot fish was used to
                 obtain behavioral information about crucian carp, which
                 was tested at five time points (1st, 7th, 14th, 21st
                 and 28th day) within 28 days. First, the fear response
                 and exploratory behavior of crucian carp affected by
                 three-color bionic robot fish were explored. Then,
                 according to the measurement results of the behavior,
                 morphology, and feeding, and the physiological and
                 biochemical properties of the crucian carp, a
                 multi-parameter evaluation method was proposed to
                 determine the adaptation period of the crucian carp
                 under this monitoring mode. The results showed that
                 more than 4 areas were occupied by crucian carp from
                 the 21st day. From the 16th day, the number of crucian
                 carp swimming with clear outlines gradually increased.
                 The number of abnormal swimming occurrences decreased
                 on day 13. More than 80\% of the crucian carp body
                 color returned to dark on the 23rd day. The crucian
                 carp did not respond to food until day 19, when most of
                 the crucian carp began to scramble for food. Food
                 consumption reached more than two thirds on day 22. In
                 addition, glucose and total protein leveled off after
                 day 21, when mean hemoglobin levels were highest.
                 Triglycerides showed a trend of first decreasing and
                 then increasing. The pigmented area of the skin section
                 gradually decreases and eventually stabilizes. In
                 summary, it takes at least 23 days for the crucian carp

                 important model organisms in behavioural neuroscience.
                 It has been shown repeatedly that different zebrafish
                 strains show large behavioural differences. These
                 divergent behavioural profiles may have a genetic
                 basis, but environmental factors and previous
                 experience are also known to greatly affect the
                 behavioural phenotype of zebrafish. It could be
                 expected that behavioural differences at the larval
                 stage should be less affected by environmental factors
                 and experience. In the present study, we screened
                 larvae of zebrafish of the AB strain and offspring of
                 wild-caught zebrafish for boldness, using an open field
                 test. In order to follow the behavioural development,
                 we studied larvae at the age of 5-, 7-, 12- and 30-days
                 post fertilization (dpf). Behaviour, as well as
                 behavioural development, clearly differed between the
                 larvae of the different strains. Wild larvae showed
                 larger total distance moved than AB larvae, both at
                 light and dark conditions. These differences were
                 already present at 12 dpf but became more pronounced
                 with age. Wild larvae had a greater variance compared
                 to AB larvae for most of the variables. We have
                 previously shown that bold and shy adult zebrafish
                 differ in the brain expression of dopamine and opioid
                 receptors. The results of the current study show that
                 wild larvae display significantly higher brain
                 expression of drd2b than AB larvae at 30 dpf, a
                 difference that could be related to differences in
                 activity. We did not detect any differences in the
                 expression of opioid receptors.",

                 catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate,
                 which plays a role in the promotion of muscle cell
                 growth and in improving the flavor of meats. In this
                 study, a GS gene encoding 371 amino acids was cloned
                 from triploid crucian carp and showed the highest level
                 of similarity with the GS gene found in Cyprinus
                 carpio. Meanwhile, GS was differentially expressed in
                 different tissues, and its day--night expression
                 changes showed obvious oscillation. Additionally, the
                 effects of glutamate and glutamine on GS expression in
                 muscle cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo. We
                 found that its expression was obviously increased due
                 to high levels of glutamate (2 mg/mL) but decreased by
                 glutamine in vitro. However, it was significantly
                 promoted by glutamate and glutamine in vivo, with an
                 optimal concentration of 2\%. Furthermore, the use of
                 lysine--glutamate dipeptides as feed additives also had
                 a positive influence on GS expression (the optimal
                 concentration is 0.8\%). Finally, we explored the
                 effects of different protein levels and sources on the
                 expression of GS, and the results demonstrated that GS
                 had the highest expression at the 35\% protein level,
                 but no significant differences were observed in the
                 different protein sources between the fish meal diet
                 (FM) and the mixed diet comprising soybean meal and
                 rapeseed meal (SM). This study sheds new light on the

  abstract =     "Climate change is a growing threat to marine organisms
                 and ecosystems, and it is already modifying ocean
                 properties by, for example, increasing temperature and
                 decreasing pH. Increasing water temperature may also
                 lead to an impairment of primary productivity and an
                 overall depletion of available zooplankton.
                 Understanding how the crossover between warming and
                 zooplankton availability impacts fish populations has
                 paramount implications for conservation and mitigation
                 strategies. Through a cross factorial design to test
                 the effects of ocean temperature and food availability
                 in a temperate marine teleost, Pomatochistus
                 flavescens, we showed that hindered feeding impacted
                 sheltering and avoidance behaviour. Also, low food
                 availability impaired fish reproduction, particularly
                 male reproduction, as the expression of cyp11b1, a gene
                 with a pivotal role in the synthesis of the most
                 important fish androgen, 11-ketotestosterone, was
                 significantly reduced under a low food regime. In
                 contrast, temperature alone did not affect reproductive
                 success, but offspring showed increased saturated fatty
                 acid content (embryos) and increased lipid peroxidation
                 (larvae). Altogether, food availability had a stronger
                 effect on fitness, showing that coping with elevated
                 temperatures, an ability that may be expected in
                 shallow-water fish, can be indirectly impacted, or even

  abstract =     "Fish population fluctuations have been widely
                 documented and are often attributed to climate
                 variability, but little is known about their
                 relationship. This is a barrier that restricts our
                 capacity to understand climate effects on fish
                 fluctuations. Here, we collected published data to
                 conduct a comparative analysis of time series in terms
                 of both scale deposition rate (SDR) and catch to
                 indicate the abundance of anchovy and explored its
                 relationships with climatic and environmental
                 parameters. We first conducted a Spearman correlation
                 analysis to identify the differences in the SDR between
                 sites. Then, we used Generalized Additive Models to
                 evaluate the effects of external forcing at multiple
                 spatial scales (i.e., local and global scales) on the
                 anchovy catches recorded at the California Current
                 Ecosystem (CCE), Humboldt Current Ecosystem (HCE), and
                 Kuroshio Current Ecosystem (KCE). We found that the
                 SDRs at different sites in the same Current Systems are
                 generally consistent, while there are more differences
                 between different systems. We also found that the
                 Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDOI), North Pacific
                 index (NPI), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index
                 (NPGOI), Sea Surface Temperature anomaly (SSTA), and
                 Air Temperature anomaly (ATA) were the most influential
                 factors explaining the variability in anchovy catch for
                 CCE, whereas the NPGOI was the most influential factor
                 for HCE. The PDOI was the best at explaining the
                 variability in anchovy catch for KCE. Our results
                 suggest that anchovy fluctuations in the Pan-Pacific
                 occurred synchronously. These seemingly unrelated
                 events, which occurred thousands of kilometers apart,
                 were actually not isolated. Therefore, we suggest that
                 large-scale climate forcing may activate synchronous
                 fluctuations for anchovy populations at the basin
                 scale, whereas local-scale environmental forces are
                 also responsible for anchovy fluctuations in the
                 ``micro-environment''.",

                 resource in the South China Sea. However, the
                 microbiological characteristics of this squid,
                 especially those of the dwarf-form, are poorly

                 dwarf-form squids of different sexes and gonadal
                 maturities were collected from South China Sea in
                 spring 2020. Results showed that Mycoplasma was the
                 most dominant group of bacteria in the intestinal
                 samples of the females with immature gonads (FN),
                 females at sexual maturity (FY), and males at sexual

                 rate, length growth rate, and yolk sac utilization
                 efficiency at the endogenous stage. The survival rate,
                 the specific growth rate (weight, length, and biomass),
                 and the gross feeding efficiency were examined at an
                 exogenous stage. The results showed that the ultrafine

                 system (UFBs-RAS) provide the dissolved oxygen
                 concentration up to 128.97\%sat. The oxygen saturated

                 possible due to surplus oxygen up to 1.58 mg/L at the
                 stock density of 100 fish/L and accomplished minimum

  abstract =     "Fish represent an excellent source of animal protein
                 as well as a biomedical research model as a result of
                 their evolutionary relatedness and similarity with the
                 human genome. Commercial and ornamental fish culture
                 has achieved popularity, but reproductive dysfunctions
                 act as a limiting factor for quality fry production,
                 interfering with the sustainability of the aquaculture
                 industry. Fish reproduction is crucial for any species'
                 existence, and reproductive performance can potentially
                 be improved through applications of epigenetics and
                 probiotics. Epigenetics is a highly sensitive molecular
                 approach that includes chromatin structure and function
                 alteration, DNA methylation, and modification of
                 non-coding RNA molecules for the transfer of desired
                 information from parents to offspring. DNA
                 methyltransferase improves reproductive cyp11a1, esr2b,
                 and figla gene expression and feminizes zebrafish
                 (Danio rerio). Moreover, epigenetics also contributes
                 to genome stability, environmental plasticity, and
                 embryonic development. However, methylation of specific
                 genes can negatively affect sperm quality, resulting in
                 poor fertilization. Probiotic administration is able to
                 induce responsiveness of incompetent follicles to
                 maturation-inducing hormones and can change oocyte
                 chemical composition during vitellogenic development.
                 The positive role of probiotics on testicular cells is
                 validated by upregulating the transcription levels of
                 leptin, bdnf, and dmrt1 genes facilitating the
                 spermatogenesis. This review not only discusses the
                 effects and mechanism of epigenetics and probiotics for
                 improving fish reproduction, but also presents an
                 overview of the causal factors and current techniques

                 an upper beak microstructure to estimate the age of
                 purpleback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis).
                 From these microstructures, the age and growth of squid
                 caught from January to March and May to August in 2018,
                 2019, and 2020 in the waters surrounding the Xisha
                 Islands in the South China Sea were determined. We
                 found three typical growth zones (the hood region,
                 crest region, and axis), abnormal increments (checks),
                 and erosion in the beak examination. The average dorsal
                 mantle length (ML) of males and females was 112.13
                 ({\pm}15.23 mm) and 119.67 mm ({\pm}24.50 mm),
                 respectively, and no squid were older than 10 months.
                 The peak hatching dates, according to back
                 calculations, were from October to January of the next
                 year. All sampled squid belonged to the autumn/winter
                 cohort. Significant sex differences were found in the
                 relationship between ML and age in squid with similar
                 growth patterns. Exponential models best described the
                 relationships of ML with age and body weight (BW) for
                 both sexes. However, a linear model best described the
                 relationship between age and upper rostrum length
                 (URL). The maximum absolute daily growth rates (AGR) of
                 BW were reached during days 240--270 for both sexes.
                 The maximum AGRs in ML were reached during days
                 180--210 and 240--270 for males and females,
                 respectively. The period of 120--150 days (4--5 months)
                 was considered the sub-adult stage of S. oualaniensis
                 in the Xisha Islands waters of the South China Sea.
                 This study confirmed that the beak microstructure

                 significant role in boosting the trade gains of both
                 developed and developing seafood-exporting countries
                 over the past three decades. In addition, the extent of
                 GVC participation has become the most important
                 platform for addressing gains from trade in developing
                 seafood-exporting countries to ensure that their
                 participation enhances economic growth. Recent studies
                 on GVC participation in developing countries have
                 highlighted the importance of domestic institutions.
                 However, the literature is silent on the quality of the
                 domestic institutions--GVC participation nexus. This
                 paper aims to investigate the determinants of GVC
                 participation and the effect of the quality of domestic
                 institutional governance on seafood-exporting
                 developing countries' GVC participation indices. Using

                 methodology to examine seafood export data from 32
                 countries from 2009 to 2018, we find that economic
                 potential drives backward GVC participation, while low
                 forward participation might not only lead to lower
                 gains from trade, but also limit countries to the
                 supply of primary seafood products with little value
                 addition. In addition, the quality of domestic
                 institutional governance constrains GVC participation.
                 Overall the results indicate that the quality of
                 domestic institutional governance matters for the GVC
                 participation of seafood-exporting developing
                 countries.",

                 After a seven-week feeding trial, growth performance,
                 hepatopancreas and muscle fatty acid (FA) composition,
                 expression of lipid-relevant genes, and blood
                 parameters were evaluated. Four isoproteic and
                 isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to
                 contain 44\% crude protein and 11\% lipids with graded
                 inclusion levels of ARA, 0\% (Control), 0.4, 0.9, and
                 1.4\% of the total diet. S. dorsalis juveniles (14.54
                 {\pm} 0.18 g) were randomly divided into twelve tanks
                 with fifteen animals each. The animals were hand fed
                 three times per day to apparent satiation. Dietary
                 treatments did not significantly affect the growth
                 performance, SGR, FCR, and feed intake of fish.
                 Different levels of ARA in the experimental diets
                 directly influenced liver and muscle FA profiles, with
                 significant changes in ARA and EPA deposition between
                 Control treatment and 1.4\%, in both tissues. The
                 expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (alox5),
                 acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (acadvl),
                 carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1(cpt1a) was
                 significantly affected by dietary treatments, with an
                 expression increasing accordingly to the increasing ARA
                 levels. In contrast, a reduction of fatty acid synthase
                 (fas) and proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppara)
                 expression was significantly reduced as ARA increased
                 in the diet. In addition, a significant reduction in
                 blood cortisol and glucose was found at a 0.9\% ARA
                 level compared to the other treatments. Based on the
                 performance, cortisol levels, the gene expression for
                 eicosanoids synthesis, and lipid metabolic pathways,

                 the most heavily exploited sharks, being the main
                 by-catch species in both tuna longline and purse-seine
                 fisheries in tropical waters worldwide. Despite this
                 severe exploitation, little is known about the species'
                 life history and population status. Silky sharks, like
                 many other sharks, exhibit slow growth and low
                 fecundity, indicating the urgency of developing
                 assessment studies to aid in the implementation of
                 conservation plans for their stocks. Because
                 information on the catch and effort of this species is
                 scarce, some length-based data-limited methods were
                 applied in the present study to provide estimates of
                 the status of the tropical Pacific silky shark
                 population. As evident from the LBSPR analysis, the
                 current spawning potential ratio (SPR) was found to be
                 below the target reference point of SPR 40\% and
                 slightly above the limit reference point of SPR 20\%.
                 In addition, the LBB model also confirmed that this
                 stock's status is overfished with relatively low
                 biomass levels. Furthermore, both models showed
                 estimates of size selectivity at 50\% and 95\% that
                 were lower than the estimated size at sexual maturity.
                 In conclusion, the data-limited models developed in
                 this study indicated that the silky shark stock in the
                 tropical Pacific Ocean may be at risk of further
                 decline. Additionally, the results show that growth and
                 recruitment overfishing may be occurring in the silky
                 shark's population calling for immediate
                 intensification of monitoring programs for these sharks
                 as a pre-requisite to develop efficient management and
                 conservation plans in the Pacific Ocean.",

                 confirm overwintering locations. From 2018 to 2020,

                 tidal influence on eDNA concentration. We examined the

                 with a time series consisting of 12 h of continuous
                 sampling throughout a tidal cycle, in conjunction with
                 the use of artificial DNA tracers and acoustic Doppler

                 years, and has the potential to be expanded to other

                 sinensis, males have a richer nutritional value and
                 higher market price than females. All-male offspring
                 were obtained by 17{\beta}-estradiol (E2). However, the
                 molecular mechanisms of E2 inducing sexual reversal
                 remain unclear. In this study, we cloned estrogen
                 nuclear receptors (ERs) from P. sinensis and
                 investigated their expression profiles. We examined the
                 responses of ER{\alpha} and ER{\beta} after treatment
                 with different concentrations of 1.0, 5.0, and 10 mg/mL
                 E2. ERs showed abundant expressions in the adult gonad,
                 ER{\alpha} for ovary, and ER{\beta} for testis. E2 can
                 up-regulate the expression of ER{\alpha}, which showed
                 a remarkable increase while the promotion of ER{\beta}
                 was unobvious. They reached a high level at stage 17
                 after the treatment of E2, genes of the female-related
                 genes Rspo1, Wnt4, {\beta}-catenin, Foxl2, Cyp19a1, and
                 Sox3 exhibited a significant raise at stage 17 with the
                 increase in the concentration of E2 while the
                 male-related genes Sox9, Dmrt1, and Amh were
                 significantly inhibited. Our study cloned the full
                 length of ERs and analyzed their structures and
                 expressions, laying a foundation for the further study

                 the marine ecosystems and are an important commercial
                 species in the East Pacific. Generally, three size
                 groups have been distinguished on the basis of the
                 mantle length (ML) of an adult. Here, fatty acid (FA)
                 analyses of muscle tissues were used to explore the
                 feeding strategies of D. gigas off the Peruvian
                 exclusive economic zone in terms of different size
                 groups and sexes. There was no significant difference
                 in fatty acid composition between the small- and
                 medium-sized groups, whereas the large-sized group
                 differed significantly from other groups. The higher
                 content of C20:4n6 and (C18:2n6 + C18:3n3) indicates
                 that the large-sized group may feed more frequently in

                 the three size groups were consistent with the results
                 of fatty acid composition, with the large-sized group
                 occupying the widest trophic niche, followed by the
                 medium-sized group and then the small-sized group. In
                 addition, there was evidence of trophic niche overlap
                 between the small and medium groups. In terms of sexual
                 variability of the small and medium groups, the fatty
                 acid composition significantly differed between females
                 and males. In terms of sexual variation of the large
                 group, the fatty acid composition between females and
                 males was similar, indicating that similar feeding
                 strategies may be adopted by them. This study revealed
                 the variability of the feeding strategies of three size

                 salmonis infestations on farmed Atlantic salmon
                 (\bioname{Salmo salar} {L.}). The review was prompted
                 by recent reports in which the usefulness of lumpfish
                 has been doubted, and the urgent need to investigate
                 whether common lumpfish can be used to reduce
                 L. salmonis numbers on farmed Atlantic salmon by active
                 grazing on this species. Available published data
                 clearly indicate that lumpfish graze on L. salmonis,
                 and can significantly lower the lice burden in Atlantic
                 salmon farming. It is possible to enhance the lice
                 grazing behavior of lumpfish with the assistance of
                 live feed conditioning prior to sea pen transfer, and
                 with selective breeding. Data indicate that lice
                 grazing of lumpfish is size dependent, and grazing
                 effect is low for lumpfish larger than 200--250
                 g. Observations from large-scale rearing of Atlantic
                 salmon in open sea cages in Norway, Iceland, the Faroe
                 Islands, and Scotland also indicate that lumpfish can
                 be effective in lowering infestations of L. salmonis on
                 salmon. Overall, this present review reveals that
                 lumpfish can actively contribute to lower numbers of

                 temporal distribution of its habitat, and how this may
                 respond to environmental changes. Using fish survey and
                 remote sensing data from 2015--2019, we applied
                 generalized additive models to identify relationships
                 between environmental factors and the distribution of
                 A. thazard in the SCS. To examine seasonal patterns in
                 the habitat of A. thazard in the SCS, we generated a
                 habitat suitability index model using environmental
                 factors screened by generalized additive models.
                 Results showed that A. thazard migrates from south to

                 0.155, optimal range ~0.1252--0.1840), and in summer to
                 be sensitive to SST (optimum 30.405, optimal range
                 ~29.789--31.021) and SSH (optimum 0.741, optimal range
                 ~0.618--0.864). Suitable habitat in spring occurs
                 mainly in northeastern areas, while in summer it occurs
                 mainly around the southeastern Nansha Islands. Compared
                 with that in spring, the area of suitable habitat
                 increases in summer, as does the habitat suitability

                 understanding of environmental factors that affect the
                 distribution of A. thazard habitat in the SCS, and

                 (C)---0.0 mg/L, with three replicates. These
                 concentrations were determined based on the LC 50 value
                 for 96 h measured for this experiment. This study
                 revealed remarkable morphological abnormalities and
                 deformities in arsenic-exposed rohu carp. In fish
                 exposed to 30 mg/L, caudal fin erosion was a frequent
                 deformity. There was no significant difference in
                 RNA:DNA ratio among the treatments. The overall weight
                 of fish was decreased as the concentration of arsenic
                 was increased. The T3 fish had a statistically
                 significant negative weight gain ({$-$0}.05 {\pm} 0.07
                 g), but the other treatments (T1 and T2) and control
                 fish had no significant weight gain. Different types of
                 histopathological changes were observed in the gills
                 and intestines of arsenic-treated fish. Necrosis and
                 severe damages were found in the secondary lamellae of
                 gills at the highest arsenic concentration (30 mg/L).
                 Epithelial lifting, irregular shape and damages in the
                 gill raker were also observed in the primary lamellae
                 of the gills for the same treatment. In this study, the
                 expression of heat shock protein (HSP 60) and
                 metallothionein (MT) genes was assessed by qPCR, and
                 these genes were upregulated in different treatments
                 compared to controls. The findings of the present study
                 suggest that arsenic pollution significantly changes
                 the morphology, behavior, growth, development,
                 histopathology and molecular mechanisms of this
                 economically important fish, rohu carp, in

  abstract =     "Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the
                 most important food fishes in global aquaculture. The
                 optimal rearing temperature for Nile tilapia is 27--30
                 {$^\circ $}C; however, in some Asian breeding areas,
                 such as south China, water temperatures in summer
                 frequently exceed 35 {$^\circ $}C for several days.
                 Potential effects of long-term exposure to high
                 temperatures on the survival and metabolism of tilapia
                 are unclear. In this study, genetically improved farmed
                 tilapia, age six weeks, were exposed to water
                 temperatures of 28, 32, and 36 {$^\circ $}C for 15
                 weeks. Mean survival rates and tolerance to hypoxia
                 were significantly reduced, and respiratory rates were
                 increased in fish reared at 36 {$^\circ $}C, compared
                 to the 28 and 32 {$^\circ $}C treatments (p {$<$}
                 0.05). Partial temperature compensation for routine
                 metabolic rates was observed after 15 weeks at 36
                 {$^\circ $}C. Gill morphology changes in the 36
                 {$^\circ $}C treatment included curling of the lamellae
                 and hyperplasia of the filament end, which became more
                 pronounced after acute hypoxia (0.2 mg/L O 2).
                 Transcriptomics demonstrated that expression of
                 numerous genes related to aerobic metabolism was
                 altered in the 36 {$^\circ $}C treatment, including
                 down-regulation of nine genes of the tricarboxylic acid
                 cycle. In summary, high temperature affected tilapia
                 gill morphology, reduced hypoxia tolerance, and
                 inhibited aerobic metabolism, thus ultimately
                 threatening tilapia viability and survival.",

                 fisheries biology, especially age and population
                 structure. Based on the 296 samples collected by the
                 Chinese commercial jigging vessel in December 2018 in
                 the Japan Sea. The age, growth, and population
                 structure of B. magister shevtsovi were studied based
                 on the microstructure of the statolith. The results
                 indicated that the range of mantle length (ML) was
                 90--148 mm for females and 94--141 mm for males, the
                 body weight (BW) ranged from 49 to 116 g and 38 to 110
                 g for females and males, and the ages were estimated
                 from 52 to 166 days for females and 51 to 143 days for
                 males, respectively. The hatching date extended from

                 suggesting the presence of one spawning group

                 was no significant sex difference between the ML and BW
                 growth; however, there was a significant difference
                 between the sexes in the relationship between ML--age
                 and BW--age. The relationship between the ML and BW was
                 best described by the power function, the ML--age
                 relationship of females was best described by linear

                 relationships of females and males were best described
                 by the exponential function. B. magister shevtsovi is a
                 high-growing squid, and the growth rate seemed to be
                 high at the young life stage and decreased after the
                 subadult stage (60--120 days older). This study
