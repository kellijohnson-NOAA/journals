  abstract =     "In a greater study of the recent fossil Gadidae, the
                 object of this paper is to better define the
                 trisopterine species and their relationships. The
                 taxonomy of the four recent species usually included in
                 the genus Trisopterus is further elaborated by means of
                 published and new data on their otoliths, by published
                 data on general external features and meristics of the
                 fishes, and their genetics. Fossil otoliths, from the
                 beginning of the Oligocene up to the present, reveal
                 much of their evolution and throw more light on their
                 relationships. Several succeeding and partly
                 overlapping lineages representing different genera are
                 recognized during this time interval. The genus
                 Neocolliolus Gaemers, 1976, for \bioname{Trisopterus
                 esmarkii} (Nilsson, 1855), is more firmly based. A new
                 genus, Allotrisopterus, is introduced for
                 \bioname{Trisopterus minutus} (Linnaeus, 1758). The
                 similarity with \bioname{Trisopterus capelanus}
                 (Lacep{\`e}de, 1800) is an example of convergent
                 evolution. The tribe Trisopterini Endo (2002) should
                 only contain Trisopterus, Allotrisopterus and
                 Neocolliolus as recent genera. Correct identification
                 of otoliths from fisheries research and from sea bottom
                 samples extends the knowledge of the present day
                 geographical distribution of T. capelanus and T. luscus
                 (Linnaeus, 1758). T. capelanus is also living along the
                 Atlantic coast of Portugal and at least up to and
                 including the R{\'\i}a de Arosa, Galicia, Spain. There
                 it can easily be mistaken for A. minutus that is also
                 living there. Otoliths of T. luscus have been
                 identified from the Evvo{\"\i}k{\'o}s Channel between
                 Euboia and the mainland of Greece, thus it must live
                 also in the Aegean Sea. Otoliths prove to be a powerful
                 tool in taxonomy, biogeography and evolution of
                 teleosts.",

                 The lipid and fatty acid profiles of White Sea herring
                 in Dvina, Kandalaksha, and Onega bays, and in the
                 waters of Tersky Shore (the mouth of the Varzuga River)
                 in autumn (after the fattening period) were studied.
                 Different methods --- thin-layer, high-performance
                 liquid and gas chromatography --- were used for this
                 purpose. Determined heterogeneity on studied parameters

                 associated with differences in trophic and hydrological
                 conditions in these bays. Variations of lipid

                 50 g KCl kg \minus 1 for 6 days affected feed intake
                 and survival of fish transferred immediately from
                 estuarine water to KDSGW of the equivalent salinity (20
                 g\cdotp L \minus 1). Experiment 2 (Exp. 2) investigated
                 whether an aquafeed fortified with zero, 10, or 25 g
                 KCl kg \minus 1 affected survival, feed intake, and

                 estuarine water (20 g\cdotp L \minus 1). The results of
                 Exp. 1 demonstrated there was no benefit of fortifying
                 aquafeed with KCl; fish transferred into KDSGW stopped
                 feeding and developed symptoms akin to tetany. Some
                 individuals also died and others became moribund. Exp.
                 1 was terminated according to animal care and ethics
                 guidelines. The results of Exp. 2 indicated the amount
                 of KCl added to the aquafeed did not affect survival,
                 feed intake, or food conversion ratio (FCR) of snapper,
                 irrespective of water treatment. However, SGR and FCR
                 was better when fish were reared in normal estuarine
                 water and KDSGW fortified to have 100\% the [K + ] of
                 equivalent salinity estuarine water. Our results
                 demonstrated that juvenile snapper were unable to
                 utilize the KCl added to the aquafeed and were probably
                 reliant on sequestering K + ions from the water column
                 in order to maintain functions involving hydromineral
                 homeostasis. Fortification of aquafeeds with KCl does
                 not ameliorate the negative effects of KDSWG on the
                 survival of juvenile snapper.",

                 Exp. 1 demonstrated there was no benefit of fortifying
                 aquafeed with KCl; fish transferred into KDSGW stopped
                 feeding and developed symptoms akin to tetany. Some
                 individuals also died and others became moribund. Exp.
                 1 was terminated according to animal care and ethics
                 guidelines. The results of Exp. 2 indicated the amount
                 of KCl added to the aquafeed did not affect survival,
                 feed intake, or food conversion ratio (FCR) of snapper,
                 irrespective of water treatment. However, SGR and FCR
                 was better when fish were reared in normal estuarine
                 water and KDSGW fortified to have 100\% the [K + ] of
                 equivalent salinity estuarine water. Our results
                 demonstrated that juvenile snapper were unable to
                 utilize the KCl added to the aquafeed and were probably
                 reliant on sequestering K + ions from the water column
                 in order to maintain functions involving hydromineral
                 homeostasis. Fortification of aquafeeds with KCl does
                 not ameliorate the negative effects of KDSWG on the
                 survival of juvenile snapper.",

                 (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation (PAF-antagonists) or
                 to induce platelet aggregation (PAF-agonists), since
                 PAF plays a crucial role in the initiation and
                 development of atherosclerosis. This study focused on
                 the polar lipids since previous studies have underlined
                 that the antithrombotic properties of foodstuffs are
                 mainly attributed to polar lipid micro-constituents.
                 TPL of sardine fillet induced platelet aggregation,
                 while TPL of cod liver had a bimodal effect on
                 platelets. TLC polar lipid fractions of both samples
                 exhibited in vitro aggregatory and inhibitory activity
                 towards platelets. However, TLC sardine polar lipid
                 fractions showed stronger in vitro antithrombotic
                 activities than the cod liver oil ones. These data
                 constitute evidence of the putative contribution of
                 fish polar lipids against cardiovascular diseases,
                 underling firstly the beneficial effect of fish and
                 fish lipids as functional foodstuffs against

                 spawning and potential fishing ground for tuna species.
                 However, few studies have been conducted on this area.
                 In this paper, the environmental preference of bigeye
                 tuna was assessed based on catch data and three main
                 environmental satellite data; namely; sea surface
                 temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll (SSC), and
                 sea surface height deviation (SSHD). Then, the
                 relationship between bigeye tuna catches and
                 environmental satellite data was analyzed by using a
                 simplified method of the Generalized Additive Model
                 (GAM) which is called scatterplot smoothers. This
                 method is the forerunner of GAM and has not yet been

                 characteristics of low SST, low SSC, and low positive
                 SSHD as well as areas with extreme SSHD values, which

                 was designed using mixture model. The inclusion level

                 60\%. Remaining 40\% comprised of basal ingredients
                 kept constant for all 10 feeds. African catfish of
                 average initial weight 35.2 \pm 0.9 g were fed with one
                 of the treatment diets for 28 days. The protein:lipid

                 evaluating the feed utilization and growth of the fish.
                 We found that catfish performances were mainly

                 protein:lipid ratios in the diets made of plant
                 ingredients were high but SGR was low. Specific growth
                 rate (SGR) increased with the increase of feed FM

                 but ca. 2\% day\minus 1 at both 60\% BNM and 60\% SBM
                 diets. SGR was similar (3.5\% day\minus 1) with diets
                 of 30\% BNM or SBM inclusion with 30\% FM. Feed
                 conversion ratio increased from below 0.6 of the 60\%
                 FM diet up to 1.5 (60\% SBM) and 1.7 (60\% BNM).
                 Protein efficiency ratio decreased linearly with
                 increasing FM substitution, but protein productive
                 value (PPV) was similar for catfish fed 60\% FM diet
                 and its 50\% substitution with BNM or SBM. These
                 results suggest that protein:lipid ratio cannot be used

                 factors. Several species of sharks showed different
                 characters than known from their descriptions that
                 could be attributed to the change of shark behavior or
                 the trypanorhynch host path. The relationship between
                 the trypanorhynch assemblage and factors for
                 carcharhiniform species alone was more robust than for
                 all sharks. In the carcharhiniform analysis, the
                 relationship between habitat type and trypanorhynch
                 assemblage was most remarkable. Overlapping host
                 ecology was evident even in phylogenetically-distant

                 Urochloa mutica (Forssk.) are pervasive throughout the
                 tropics, but the impacts on estuarine habitats and
                 biota are poorly understood. After weed control was
                 reduced in a tropical estuary, U. mutica reinvaded this
                 area composed of two contiguous habitats: a shallow
                 pond and a deeper river. These habitats are especially
                 important for \bioname{Mugil cephalus}, a culturally
                 prized native mullet, and introduced Moolgarda engeli
                 not targeted in the fishery. We investigated the
                 potential impacts of U. mutica on juvenile and adult
                 mullets by comparing the catch per unit effort (CPUE)
                 of the two mullet species and the physiochemical
                 measurements from the two contiguous habitats during
                 different stages of its reinvasion. Overall, negative
                 effects on the CPUE of M. cephalus and M. engeli were
                 found as a result of the U. mutica reinvasion. The M.
                 cephalus CPUE was consistently higher in the shallow
                 pond habitat compared to the deeper river habitat. It
                 decreased after U. mutica was established, correlative
                 to the invasive grass canopies smothering the shallow
                 habitat favored by juveniles. The M. engeli CPUE
                 significantly declined during the initial periods of U.
                 mutica reinvasion, but did not decline further after
                 the grass became established. No differences in the M.
                 engeli CPUE between habitats were found, indicating
                 that M. engeli are habitat generalists. These findings
                 are among the first in an insular tropical estuary
                 demonstrating a negative relationship between an
                 invasive grass and relative abundances of two
                 confamiliar fish, while revealing distinct patterns
                 attributed to species-specific traits. Importantly, the
                 broad overlapping biogeographic distribution of M.
                 cephalus and U. mutica, and the negative relationship
                 between these species, raises widespread concern for

                 native fishes and may compete with prized sportfish
                 juveniles in estuarine nursery habitat. Long-term
                 monitoring revealed that B. belizanus occurs in
                 estuarine waterbodies along a 31-km stretch of the
                 bay's eastern fringe, with a second, smaller population

                 to be 5.5--13 km year \minus 1, intermediate among

                 ecological barriers. Further B. belizanus spread
                 therefore may be most likely to occur by human release
                 (from aquaria or bait buckets) or bird carry-off. Newly
                 restored tidal habitat within the current range
                 probably will be invaded quite quickly by B.

                 recognized as one of the most promising fish species
                 for aquaculture diversification in the Persian Gulf and
                 the Oman Sea regions. In this regard, S. hasta has
                 received considerable attention, and nutritional
                 studies focused on establishing the nutritional
                 requirements for improving diet formulation have been
                 conducted during recent years. Considering the results
                 from different dose--response nutritional studies on
                 macronutrient requirements conducted in this species,
                 it can be concluded that diets containing ca. 48\%
                 crude protein, 15\% crude lipid, 15\% carbohydrates and
                 20 KJ g \minus 1 gross energy are recommended for
                 on-growing S. hasta juveniles. In addition, the optimum
                 essential amino acid profile for this species
                 (expressed as g 16 g N \minus 1), should be
                 approximately arginine 5.3, lysine 6.0, threonine 5.2,
                 histidine 2.5, isoleucine 4.6, leucine 5.4, methionine
                 + cysteine 4.0 (in a diet containing 0.6 cysteine),
                 phenylalanine + tyrosine 5.6 (in a diet containing 1.9
                 tyrosine), tryptophan 1.0 and valine 4.6. Moreover, the
                 optimum dietary n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty
                 acids and soybean lecithin are recommended to be 0.8\%
                 and 6\%, respectively. The maximum replacement of fish
                 meal with soy protein is recommended to be between
                 16.5\% and 27.3\%. In addition, different vegetal oil
                 sources are also recommended for partial and almost
                 complete replacement of fish oil in diets. Although the
                 nutritional requirements in terms of macronutrients
                 have been established under laboratory conditions, the
                 analysis of the available literature indicate that

                 characteristics such as high concentrations of carbon.
                 The oxygen can be considered a key factor since

                 water oxygen (from 6 \pm 1 to 13 \pm 1 mg/L) on
                 lymphocytes density in sea bass by using flow cytometry

                 aberrant codfishes with several extinct and currently
                 only one recognized extant species. The oldest
                 representatives of a Gadiculus lineage known from
                 otoliths are Early Miocene in age. Fossil evidence has
                 showed Gadiculus to originate from older genera
                 diverging early from other true cods of the family
                 Gadidae. As adult specimens of different species have
                 been found to be highly similar and difficult to
                 distinguish based on meristic and morphometric data,
                 the number of species in this gadid genus has been
                 controversial since different larval morphotypes were
                 first discovered some 100 years ago. For almost 70
                 years, Gadiculus thori and Gadiculus argenteus have
                 been considered subspecies only, with a distribution in
                 the Northeast Atlantic Ocean including the
                 Mediterranean. In this study, we resolve the
                 long-standing issue of extant Gadiculus not being
                 monotypic. New results in the form of distinct adult
                 otoliths and molecular data unambiguously show two
                 species of Gadiculus present --- in agreement with
                 larval morphotypes. Morphometric, meristic and
                 molecular characters, as well as larval pigmentation
                 are discussed in addition to present and past
                 geographic distributions of the two taxa from
                 distributions of fossil otoliths. At present, the
                 cold-water species Gadiculus thori (northern silvery
                 pout) is distributed in cold-temperate and subarctic
                 latitudes in the Northeast Atlantic, including a new
                 range extension off Southeast Greenland. Gadiculus
                 argenteus (southern silvery pout) occurs in warmer
                 waters and is distributed in the warm-temperate East
                 Atlantic and Mediterranean. Fossil otoliths show that

                 structure. These features were observed from days 2 to
                 4, considered the early stage of construction. The
                 mystery circle had radially aligned peaks and valleys
                 with a central flat area, while the radius and the
                 differences in elevation between the peaks and valleys
                 were increasing. These features, which were observed
                 from days 5 to 8, were considered the middle stage of
                 construction. On day 9, the mystery circle was
                 completed. An irregular pattern was formed in the
                 central area, and the radially aligned peaks were
                 decorated with shell and coral fragments. These are the
                 first recorded observations of construction of a
                 mystery circle from the earliest stage.",

  abstract =     "Little is known about the concerted influence of
                 temperature and salinity on the fecundity of clupeid
                 fishes. Due to a globally changing climate, both
                 physical parameters might act as stressors, severely
                 affecting the reproductive potential of clupeid fish
                 populations inhabiting tropical estuaries. Differences
                 in relative batch fecundities, the gonado-somatic
                 index, and the condition index of bonga shad
                 (\bioname{Ethmalosa fimbriata}) were analysed in
                 individual females sampled at the Senegalese coast and
                 inside the inverse Sine Saloum estuary, where salinity
                 increases upstream in all seasons. Multiple linear
                 regression models on fecundity and gonadal energy
                 storage show that clupeids can adapt towards increasing
                 their reproductive investment at temperatures (26--30
                 \degree C) and salinities (42--51), which by far exceed
                 marine conditions, in an effort to maximize recruitment
                 success. This reproductive strategy, however, is
                 accompanied by a trade-off between reproductive effort
                 and somatic growth, which ultimately limits the
                 species' reproductive potential inside the estuary. The
                 observed high variability in batch fecundities might be
                 a viable mechanism to adjust to fluctuating and rather
                 extreme environmental conditions. Understanding the
                 spawning biology of exploited clupeid fishes in
                 drastically changing environments is crucial for
                 evaluating the reproductive potential of stocks at the
                 outer reach of their physiological performance curve.",

                 the fish's freshness. To investigate this, live red sea
                 breams were purchased, slaughtered, and prior to
                 measurement, stored at 22 \pm 2 \degree C for 27 h.
                 During subsequent storage, the K value of the dorsal
                 meat --- as a standard freshness indicator --- along
                 with front-face fluorescence spectra of representative
                 dorsal scales, were measured simultaneously at 3 h
                 intervals. Two major fluorescent peaks, A and B, were
                 identified with excitation and emission wavelength
                 pairs of 280/310 nm and 340/420 nm, which were mainly
                 contributed to by tyrosine and collagen, respectively.
                 Subsequent analysis showed that the fluorescence
                 intensity ratio of peak B to A (I B / I A) increased
                 linearly during storage (R 2 = 0.95) and is proposed as
                 a potential non-destructive index of fish freshness.
                 Thus, our results suggest that the fluorescence
                 characteristics of fish scales can be used to assess

                 officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), a promising aquaculture

                 photocells, allowing the monitoring of locomotor
                 activity continuously from August to February. Results
                 showed a preference of cuttlefish for being active
                 during the night in summer (24.2 \pm 1.3 \degree C) and
                 in autumn (18.4 \pm 3.4 \degree C), with maximum
                 activity peaks observed, respectively, at 01:09 h and

                 currently hindering the control over the lifecycle of
                 common octopus (\bioname{Octopus vulgaris} Cuvier,
                 1797). It is believed that this problem might be
                 related to either zoo-technical and/or nutritional
                 aspects. The present paper is focused on the study of
                 different zoo-technical aspects related to light
                 conditions on the rearing of paralarvae, including the
                 effects of polarization in prey ingestion, the use of a
                 blue filter to simulate natural conditions, and the use
                 of focused light to avoid reflections of the rearing
                 tank's walls. In the first experiment, O. vulgaris
                 paralarvae ingestion of Artemia sp. and copepods (Tisbe
                 sp.) was assessed under either normal or polarized
                 light. In the second experiment, the effect of a blue
                 filter with natural light or focused artificial light
                 on growth and mortality was assessed over 15 days of
                 rearing. Ingestion rate was not influenced by light
                 polarization. Nonetheless, a significantly higher
                 ingestion of Artemia sp. with respect to copepods was
                 observed. The blue filter promoted the use of natural
                 light conditions in Octopus paralarval culture, while
                 focused light reduced the collision of the paralarvae
                 against the walls. However, no significant differences

                 expression during early development, and upon
                 experimental immune challenge in adult animals, with
                 the goal of establishing this genetically-tractable
                 model system for further AMP studies. By mining
                 available genomic databases, zebrafish AMP sequences
                 homologous to AMPs from other vertebrates were selected
                 for further study. These included parasin I and its
                 enzyme cathepsin D, \beta -defensin (DB1),
                 liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2),
                 bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), and
                 chromogranin-A and -B (CgA and CgB). Specific primers
                 were designed for RT-PCR amplification of each AMP gene
                 of interest and amplicons between 242 bp and 504 bp
                 were obtained from RNA extracted from adult zebrafish.
                 Sequencing of the amplicons and alignment of their
                 deduced amino acid sequences with those from AMPs from
                 other vertebrate species confirmed their identity. The
                 temporal expression of AMPs was investigated by RT-PCR
                 analysis in fertilized oocytes, embryos, and adult
                 individuals. Parasin I and chatepsin D transcripts were
                 detectable immediately after fertilization, while the
                 transcripts for CgA and CgB became evident starting at
                 48 h post fertilization. Mature transcripts of LEAP2
                 and DB1 were detectable only in the adult zebrafish,
                 while BPI transcripts were detectable starting from the
                 12th day post fertilization. To explore the possible
                 upregulation of AMP expression by infectious challenge,
                 experiments were carried out in adult zebrafish by
                 intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of
                 lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. Except for
                 CgA and CgB, amplicons corresponding to all tested AMPs
                 showed stronger signals in the experimental animals as
                 compared to the unchallenged controls. This study
                 provided information on the early expression of AMPs in
                 zebrafish from ontogeny to adulthood and their
                 inducibility by microbials. This information could be
                 useful to actuate new prophylactic strategies as an
                 alternative to the use of antibiotics in culture.",

  abstract =     "The management of highly migratory species (HMS) is a
                 complex domestic and international system that was
                 initially established to regulate HMS taken in
                 commercial fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. For
                 managing HMS taken in recreational fisheries, the
                 authority and the data required is lacking and remains
                 to be stipulated by regulating bodies. In the {United
                 States}, Florida saltwater anglers target various HMS,
                 but swordfish (\bioname{Xiphias gladius}) is a favorite
                 among anglers. The recreational swordfish fishery off
                 the Southeast Florida coast has experienced resurgence
                 in recent years, with directed tournaments resuming in
                 2001 after being absent almost 20 years. Today, South
                 Florida supports the largest group of recreational
                 swordfish anglers in the world. Despite the increasing
                 popularity and interest, little data is available
                 describing the recreational swordfish fishery and its
                 socio-economic aspects in South Florida. This study
                 aimed to compile, describe, and identify the
                 demographics, fishing tactics, costs, and fishery
                 management perceptions of recreational swordfish
                 anglers in South Florida based on nonprobability
                 purposive sampling organized through the Southeast
                 Swordfish Club (SESC). The sample size (n = 38)
                 represented about 16--38\% of the SESC members and
                 between 6\% and 8\% of the recreational anglers that
                 actively targeted swordfish in South Florida during the
                 time of the survey. We acknowledge the sample size was
                 small (n = 38), but believe the study encompassed the
                 most active swordfish anglers given their knowledge,
                 expertise, and connection with the fishery in terms of
                 participants, fishing effort, and fishing techniques.
                 As such, it is highly probable that a large portion of
                 the recreational swordfish angling population was
                 represented by members of the SESC in terms of
                 swordfishing gear, techniques, and socio-economics,
                 which reduced apparent bias in the study. Overall, the
                 annual income of recreational swordfish anglers in 2007
                 ranged from US \$15,000 to \$200,000 with an average
                 income of \$91,940 ($ n = 33$). Sixty-nine percent of
                 polled anglers indicated they had more than 26 years of
                 recreational fishing experience and 81\% had less than
                 10 years of experience targeting swordfish in South
                 Florida. Thirty-seven percent of surveyed anglers
                 indicated they departed from Port Everglades, Florida.
                 To target swordfish, anglers generally used five rods
                 and set their bait, commonly squid, at 91 m. Anglers
                 also indicated they changed their fishing tactics from
                 day to night, and took about five fishing trips per
                 month. Overall, anglers spent around \$14,210 on annual
                 costs associated with swordfishing, which was 16\% of
                 their annual income. Many polled anglers also reported
                 they were dissatisfied with the current swordfish
                 management regulations.",

                 sampling sites during winter season targeting the
                 collection of fish species. A total of 48 samples were
                 collected. Individuals from seven different taxa
                 (marine and estuarine) were collected, although the
                 assemblage was dominated by two estuarine species ---
                 the native Pomatoschistus sp. (goby) and the NIS
                 \bioname{Fundulus heteroclitus} (mummichog). Goby was
                 the most abundant taxa in the majority of salt marsh
                 habitats, except for one specific, marsh pool, where
                 extreme environmental conditions were registered,
                 namely high temperature and salinity. Such conditions
                 may have boosted the intrusion of mummichog in this
                 area. This species is well adapted to a wide range of
                 abiotic factors enabling them to colonize habitats
                 where no predators inhabit. Impacts of mummichog
                 introduction in the Guadiana salt marsh area are still
                 unpredictable since this is the first time they have
                 been recorded in such high density. Nevertheless, in
                 scenarios of increased anthropogenic pressure and,
                 consequently, habitat degradation, there is a potential
                 risk of mummichog spreading to other habitats and
                 therefore competing for space and food resources with
                 native species.",

                 usually lacking in some essential amino acids and fatty

                 good-quality protein with amino acids rich in
                 methionine, lysine and alanine. Four novel diets having
                 C. vulgaris as the main source of protein were produced
                 for African catfish \bioname{Clarias gariepinus} with
                 an initial average weight of 1.09 \pm 0.05 g. The diets
                 were labeled Feed 1 (F1) to feed 4 (F4). The treatment
                 diets were included 25\% (F1), 15\% (F2), 5\% (F3) and
                 0\% (F4) green algae meal. The basal ingredients of the
                 feed were corn (maize) included as F1, 40\%, F2, 43\%,
                 F3, 53\% and F4, 43\%; and millet meal, which varied in
                 F1 as 23\%, F2, 30\%, F3, 30\% and F4, 30\%. The
                 ingredients were preconditioned at 110 \degree C and
                 pelleted. Post-fingerling African catfish were stocked
                 at 10 fish per aquarium. There were three replicate
                 aquariums for each feed type and the fish were fed for
                 60 d. The specific growth rate was best for the catfish
                 fed with 25\% C. vulgaris diet 7.86 \pm 0\% day \minus
                 1, and worst at 6.77 \pm 0.07\% day \minus 1 for the
                 control group F4, 0\% algal meal. The food conversion
                 ratio (FCR) was lowest (1.88 \pm 0.02) for 25\% algal
                 meal diet (F1) and highest (2.98 \pm 0.01) for the 0\%
                 algal meal diet F4. Similarly, catfish had average
                 weight gain of 121.02 \pm 0.04 g for those fed with F1
                 compared to 62.50 \pm 0.0 g for those fed with 0\%
                 algae F4. Protein efficiency ratio was highest for the
                 F1-fed fish (2.46 \pm 0.22) and lowest for those fed
                 with F4 (2.02 \pm 0.09). The hepatosomatic index was
                 lowest for F1-fed fish (1.48 \pm 0.01) and highest for
                 catfish fed with F4 (2.50 \pm 0.59). Based on the
                 results, C. vulgaris is a good protein source for
                 African catfish and can also substitute fishmeal in the
                 catfish diets.",

                 Barbonymus gonionotus. Post fingerlings of B.
                 gonionotus were reared in five treatments, labeled T 1
                 to T 5, by substituting 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and
                 100\% protein of CFF with A. pinnata protein (dry
                 matter basis) respectively for 56 days. The specific
                 growth rate, net production rate, protein efficiency
                 ratio, proximate composition, and overall conditions of
                 fish were not significantly varied between the fish
                 reared completely with CFF and 25\% substitution with
                 A. pinnata. However, a significantly higher profit rate
                 (431.49 USD ha \minus 1 56 day \minus 1) was calculated
                 for fish reared in T 2 than other treatments. In
                 contrast, there was a significant reduction of growth
                 and other parameters of the fish that were observed in
                 the case where more than 25\% CFF was substituted with
                 A. pinnata. The poorest performance was observed in
                 fish fed completely with A. pinnata, at T 5. Based on
                 the results, 25\% of CFF of Thai silver barb could be
                 substituted with fresh A. pinnata without significantly
                 lowering their growth and product quality and could
                 contribute significant to a higher profit margin.",

                 suggested as suitable sublethal endpoints for human and
                 environmental hazard assessment, as well as for
                 biomonitoring applications. Larval stages of the sand
                 goby (\bioname{Pomatoschistus minutus}) possess a
                 number of attractive qualities for experimental testing
                 that make it a promising species in behavioural
                 ecotoxicology. Here, we present a study aimed at
                 developing a toolkit for using the sand goby as novel
                 species for ecotoxicological studies and using
                 locomotion as an alternative endpoint in toxicity
                 testing. Exposure to three contaminants (copper (Cu),
                 di-butyl phthalate (DBP) and perfluorooctanoic acid
                 (PFOA)) was tested in the early life stages of the sand
                 goby and the locomotion patterns of the larvae were
                 quantified using an automatic tracking system. In a
                 photo-motor test, sand goby larvae displayed
                 substantially higher activity in light than in dark
                 cycles. Furthermore, all tested compounds exerted
                 behavioural alterations, such as hypo- and
                 hyperactivity. Our experimental results show that sand
                 goby larvae produce robust and quantifiable locomotive
                 responses, which could be used within an
                 ecotoxicological context for assessing the behavioural
                 toxicity of environmental pollutants, with particular
                 relevance in the Nordic region. This study thus
                 suggests that sand goby larvae have potential as an
                 environmentally relevant species for behavioural
                 ecotoxicology, and as such offer an alternative to
                 standard model species.",

  abstract =     "Blooms of the planktonic alga \bioname{Prymnesium
                 parvum} pose a global threat, causing fish kills
                 worldwide. Early studies on the exposure of fish to P.
                 parvum indicate that toxic effects are related to gill
                 damage. The more strictly defined concept of adverse
                 outcome pathways has been suggested as a replacement
                 for the mode of action in toxicology studies. In this
                 study, rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) were exposed
                 to P. parvum. During exposure, oxygen consumption was
                 determined by respirometry, and ventilation and
                 coughing rate were determined via video surveillance.
                 Per breath oxygen consumption was calculated to assess
                 the ventilation effort to obtain a unit of oxygen. A
                 second experiment monitored fish behavior to assess
                 recovery. The results indicated that oxygen consumption
                 initially increased, but on average fell below the
                 standard oxygen consumption at 70\% relative exposure.
                 Being a function of ventilation frequency and oxygen
                 consumption, the per breath oxygen consumption
                 decreased throughout exposure. Behavioral results
                 determined that short-term P. parvum exposure
                 subsequently caused the exposed fish to seek flow
                 refuge immediately and to a greater extent than
                 unexposed fish. The adverse outcome pathway of P.
                 parvum on rainbow trout is that P. parvum acts as a
                 gill irritant resulting in non-recoverable respiratory
                 failure.",

                 animal from its always hazardous environment. Many
                 techniques have been used for its study, but certain
                 structural characteristics of fish skin still remain
                 not clearly understood. That is the case with scales,
                 which have always been attributed a mere protective
                 role, but which are proving to have more functions than
                 it was traditionally thought. To acquire a deeper
                 knowledge, scales from six different regions of
                 gilthead seabream (\bioname{Sparus aurata} {L.}) were
                 studied and measured by image analysis. Results prove
                 that scales from the base of the dorsal fin are larger
                 than those in other parts of the fish body while scales
                 from the peduncle are the smallest of the skin.
                 Furthermore, a technique relatively new in this field,
                 known as atomic force microscopy (AFM), was used to
                 obtain representations of the ultrastructure of the
                 scales and measure certain features such as the circuli
                 and the lines in the basal layer. The data obtained
                 allowed us to compare the height of circuli among the
                 different scales, showing that they were higher in
                 scales from the dorsum and the operculum. The present
                 results introduce a nanostructural model of the scales
                 of gilthead seabream that might serve as a useful
                 guideline for future studies.",

                 important to minimize such effects and one option is
                 the use of dietary additives. In the present

                 specimens were fed three different diets: a control

                 tryptophan-supplemented diet and an
                 aspartate-supplemented diet. For each diet, fish were

                 increasingly recognize the importance of mycotoxins,
                 which contaminate plant-based meals used in compound
                 aquafeeds, and their potential to negatively impact
                 production. Though data on the worldwide occurrence of
                 legislated mycotoxins e.g., trichothecenes and
                 zearalenone (ZEN) are well documented, relatively
                 little information is available regarding other
                 mycotoxins also produced by Fusarium, notably
                 moniliformin (MON). Given that MON is known to affect
                 the survival, growth, skeletal formation and bone
                 mineralization in terrestrial species, its widespread
                 occurrence on maize and maize by-products typically
                 used in aquaculture makes it relevant to study these
                 parameters in teleost fish. In the present work we have
                 tested the effect of MON exposure on survival, bone
                 development and mineralization using zebrafish
                 (\bioname{Danio rerio}) as a model species and fish
                 derived osteo-chondroprogenitor cell line for in vitro
                 studies. Moniliformin exposure did not decrease bone
                 mineralization in zebrafish larvae or extracellular
                 matrix mineralization in the mineralogenic cell line
                 VSa13. Here, the minimal in vitro cytotoxicity
                 concentration was found to be 1000 $ \mu $ g L \minus 1
                 MON. Incidence of deformities was also not altered by
                 MON at the concentration tested (450 $ \mu $ g L \minus
                 1) although larval growth was affected, as shown by a
                 decrease in the standard length of exposed specimens at
                 20 days post fertilization. Survival decreased
                 significantly in larvae exposed to MON concentrations
                 higher than 900 \mu g L \minus 1. Influence of MON on
                 survival and growth might be relevant for aquaculture
                 industry. As MON is a water-soluble mycotoxin, its
                 leaching from feed is highly probable, so MON
                 assimilation into the surrounding aqueous environment
                 should also be considered. Tested levels in fish larvae
                 are within the reported occurrence levels of MON in
                 commercial feed and plant meals.",

                 prepared from dry-cured tuna loins in southern Portugal
                 and Spain. The production procedure has seen little
                 change over the last centuries. The muxama's stability
                 is due to reduced water activity. In addition, the
                 drying method has secondary effects on characteristics
                 of flavor, color, and the nutritional value of the
                 product. Our objectives were to describe the dynamics
                 of important physicochemical parameters such as
                 moisture content, water activity (a W), NaCl
                 concentration (as water--phase salt, Z NaCl), pH and
                 color, during the salting and drying stages of muxama
                 production, and to test the effect(s) of changes in the
                 traditional processing conditions followed in southern
                 Portugal, aiming at optimizing the production
                 procedure. The lowest values of moisture and a W and
                 highest Z NaCl obtained after drying tuna loins for
                 seven days at 20 \degree C exceeded the values reported
                 for commercial products and have impact on the
                 appearance (color) of the product. Therefore, drying
                 tuna loins at lower temperatures (ca. 14 \degree C) is
                 probably more appropriate. The results obtained in this
                 study could be used in the design of future experiments
                 at other conditions and to assess other quality
                 parameters, e.g., total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N),

                 microorganism abundance and sensory attributes, and

                 casulo digging by issuing a regulation (Ordinance) in
                 2014 on the maximum daily catch limit to be caught by
                 each individual. The daily catch limit is intended to
                 represent the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) for
                 casulo beyond which overfishing will occur. The
                 monitoring of the regulatory measures is expected to be
                 conducted through on-site inspections in the digging
                 areas. However, weak law enforcement was noticed, while
                 there is also controversy over the daily catch limit
                 (quota) stipulated by the Ordinance. To this end, the
                 current study attempted to assess digging activities
                 through remote monitoring and random inspections for a
                 better policy enforcement of the national regulation.
                 In addition, different harvesting scenarios were
                 employed through a simplified bioeconomic model to
                 attribute the current and future harvesting trends of
                 bait digging in Aveiro coastal lagoon. The study
                 findings indicate that remote monitoring coupled with
                 some onsite interviews could be a more effective
                 approach for the implementation of the current bait
                 digging policy. Further, the results point to a
                 distinctive discrepancy between the daily catch amount
                 (MSY) introduced by the national legislation and the
                 study findings which should be further scrutinized. The
                 diggers seem to have reached the sustainable harvest
                 identified by the present research. The current
                 economic hardship in Portugal and the low profitability
                 in similar employment sectors will possibly attract
                 more diggers and increase harvesting in the near
                 future. An increased harvest would likely trigger
                 overfishing of D. neapolitana with unknown consequences
                 for the population of the species as well as the
                 aquatic ecosystem. The socio-economic and environmental
                 effects are yet to be further clarified with more
                 detailed data and advanced modeling techniques to
                 ensure the sustainability of the activity.",

                 systems has long been recognized in vertebrates. In
                 fish, it is known that the prevalence and intensity of
                 such infections are higher in males than in females and
                 probably related to sex steroid hormone levels. In
                 addition, the immune response in the fish gonad tissues
                 is specifically regulated to prevent infertility. This
                 condition is used by some pathogens to colonize the
                 fish gonad, evade the systemic immune response, and so
                 spread to the progeny. This review brings up to date
                 our knowledge concerning fish gonad immunity and its
                 regulation, immune-endocrine interactions, and how some

                 associated to vertical transmission since it is
                 detected in gonad fluids as well as in testicular
                 gametes. In fact, sea bass immunity in the gonad is
                 regulated in a very different way to other target
                 tissues (brain and retina) or immune-relevant tissues

                 main objectives of the present study were to identify
                 the breeding season of Pool barb through observation of
                 the gonadosomatic index (GSI), fecundity, oocytes
                 diameter, and gonadal histology of the species. GSI was
                 calculated and fecundity was determined by the
                 gravimetric method. Interestingly, the highest value of
                 GSI was 15.43 \pm 2.20 for the month of April at
                 Gazipur while it was 15.60 \pm 1.74 in June for
                 Jessore. In Gazipur, the highest fecundity (5053 \pm

                 highest fecundity (5433 \pm 968.26) was recorded in the
                 month of June for Jessore. Histology of the ovary of
                 Pool barb shows the presence of early and late
                 perinucleolar stage of oocytes during March indicating
                 immature oocyte. Histological data revealed that the
                 spawning season of Pool barb starts from March to July
                 with a peak during April to May for Gazipur region and
                 May to July for Jessore region. Finally, these results

                 farmed salmon (\bioname{Salmo salar}) for the targeted

                 mucus was either scraped off, wiped off using medical

                 the targeted analysis of 86 small metabolites, of which
                 up to 60 were detected in absorbed mucus. Untargeted
                 analysis of the mucus samples from equally treated

                 small-molecule metabolomics of skin mucus in fish would
                 benefit from a sampling regime employing absorption of
                 the water phase in order to minimize the bias related
                 to the sampling step. Furthermore, the absorption
                 method is also a less invasive approach allowing for

                 species that had migrated via the Suez Canal. Trawl
                 data from the Israeli coast spanning two periods
                 (1990--1994 and 2008--2011) were compared to identify
                 species with substantial variation in their relative
                 abundance between the two periods. The aim of this
                 study was to examine if certain ecological traits
                 characterize fish species showing an increase or
                 decrease in relative abundance, and if non-indigenous
                 fishes with strongly increasing populations may have
                 caused the decline of native species with similar
                 habitats and diets. We found that the main predictors
                 of population trends were species length, habitat
                 affinity, and maximum depth, with larger and soft
                 bottom species displaying decreasing abundances.
                 Comparing native and non-indigenous fishes with similar
                 habitat and diet, we found a potential for competitive
                 impact of the Indo-Pacific \bioname{Plotosus lineatus}
                 and two Upeneus spp. on the native Mullus species.
                 However, competition with non-indigenous fishes could
                 not generally explain the dramatic decline of many
                 other native species between the two study periods.
                 Alternative causes, such as fishery pressure and
                 increasing water temperature, are discussed.",

                 selection programs using hatchery-produced breeding
                 stocks. The greater amberjack \bioname{Seriola
                 dumerili} is a cosmopolitan pelagic species that has
                 been considered as a good candidate for the species
                 diversification of aquaculture production in the
                 Mediterranean region. However, commercial production is
                 still very limited due to bottlenecks in reproduction,
                 larval rearing and management control during grow out.
                 The aim of the present study was to examine the
                 reproductive development of hatchery-produced greater
                 amberjack and to develop a spawning induction protocol
                 based on the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone
                 agonist (GnRHa) in a controlled-release delivery
                 system. The results showed that hatchery-produced
                 greater amberjack undergo normal gametogenesis and can
                 be induced to undergo maturation, ovulation and
                 spawning after multiple administrations of GnRHa
                 implants, over an extended spawning period lasting from
                 May to September in the Canary Islands, Spain. The use
                 of GnRHa-delivery systems resulted in multiple spawns
                 of fertilized and viable eggs. Egg production was high
                 and egg quality adequate for the implementation of
                 larval rearing for commercial purposes. The handling
                 required to administer the GnRHa implants during the
                 prolonged spawning season did not result in any
                 negative effect on the welfare and reproductive
                 performance of the fish based on evaluation of several
                 biochemical parameters. The developed reproduction
                 control method shows great potential to advance the
                 commercial production of greater amberjack, by enabling

                 Improving the quality of their meat will produce
                 fillets that may have a higher economic value in the
                 market, and thus be beneficial for the management of
                 this fishery. In other animal species destined for
                 human consumption, a negative relationship between
                 pre-slaughtering stress and meat quality has been
                 demonstrated. By studying the commercial small-spotted
                 catshark (\bioname{Scyliorhinus canicula}), this work
                 aimed at linking pre-slaughter handling of captured
                 sharks and muscle fillets quality. An experimental
                 group of adult and subadult living catsharks captured
                 by hand and exposed to air (for 18 min, which is the
                 minimum time this species is exposed to air in the
                 fishing deck during fisheries procedures), and an
                 undisturbed group, were evaluated. After air exposure,
                 catsharks returned to water for recovery. Muscle
                 lactate and water content were quantified after acute
                 exposure (for 18 min), 5 h and 24 h. This challenge
                 elicited stress responses in the muscle such as
                 increased lactate levels and immediate dehydration,
                 followed by recovery of lactate levels and
                 overhydration. Muscle consistency, a relevant variable
                 describing quality of seafood according to its ability
                 to be swallowed by the consumer, paralleled muscle
                 water content changes. The results indicated for the
                 first time that handling alive sharks exposed to air
                 results in muscle fillets with different texture
                 properties. Whether these changes in muscle texture
                 induce higher quality fillets has yet to be proven. Our
                 recommendation is to minimize time of air exposure
                 experienced by sharks when captured, including fast
                 slaughtering instead of leaving them to die by
                 asphyxia, as current on-board procedures.",

                 is likely occurring and thumbprint emperor are commonly
                 represented in catches. The goal of this study was to
                 estimate age and growth to provide basic life history

                 sampled a total of n = 55 thumbprint emperors from both

                 Annular age estimates were improved with measurements
                 of otolith markings. Fish ages ranged from zero to five
                 years. We also evaluated the addition of otolith edge
                 size (a proxy for fractional age) to age estimation,
                 and fit two von Bertalanffy growth models---one for the
                 whole ages and one for the fractional ages---using a
                 flexible Bayesian framework. Growth parameters were

                 were comparable to other published values for the
                 species, although our estimates of K (growth

                 is the most common shark landed in Indonesian waters,
                 including in the Indian Ocean. However, even though
                 they are frequently caught, there is a lack of
                 information on the population and abundance of silky
                 sharks in the Indian Ocean. Cilacap and Tanjung Luar
                 are two of Indonesia's shark fishery hotspots, both
                 located on the edge of the Indian Ocean, which is a
                 part of the Indonesian Fisheries Management Area (FMA)
                 573. The fishers from both places usually have fishing
                 grounds in that particular fisheries management area.
                 This research aims to update the abundance, and to
                 investigate the factors, which influence catches of
                 silky shark in the FMA 573 based on monthly enumeration

                 popular in some European countries such as Poland,
                 France and Ireland. These systems generally operate in
                 flow-through configuration. The impact such production
                 systems might have on water quality remains mostly
                 unknown. The present study was set up to fulfil this
                 objective of monitoring water quality on different fish
                 farm locations in order to identify the impacts of the
                 whole farm (comparison of farm inlet and outlet) and at

                 dynamics and to better understand the impact of
                 multiple water reuse (water passes) in a given pond on
                 water quality. In the absence of any sort of water
                 treatment, an increase in the number of water passes
                 was shown to create an increase in ammonium
                 concentration along the farm. Finally, this traditional
                 flow-through rainbow trout production system was
                 revealed to almost be at its full carrying capacity
                 with respect to internal water quality parameters and
                 fish welfare. To increase fish production, some water
                 treatment techniques (solid/liquid separation,
                 nitrification) would have to be introduced in order to
                 optimize the rearing water quality for fish growth and
                 to minimize the release of pollutants in the receiving
                 water to limit the impact on the environment.",

                 \bioname{Scomber japonicus} (chub mackerel) and
                 \bioname{Scomber australasicus} (blue mackerel).
                 Because S. japonicus has a much higher market price
                 than S. australasicus, the two species must be properly
                 sorted before shipment, but their similar appearance
                 makes discrimination difficult. These species can be
                 effectively distinguished using the ratio of the base
                 length between the dorsal fin's first and ninth spines
                 to the fork length. However, manual measurement of this
                 ratio is time-consuming and reduces fish freshness. The
                 proposed technique instead uses image processing to
                 measure these lengths. We were able to successfully
                 discriminate between the two species using the ratio as
                 a geometric feature, in combination with several
                 texture features. We then quantitatively verified the
                 effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrated

                 a multifactorial experiment with three
                 resource-impacting stressors --- limited food
                 availability, a parasitic infection, exposure to a
                 vitellogenesis-inducing contaminant --- and
                 combinations thereof. Treatment with the individual
                 stressors evoked the expected responses in the
                 respective physiological target systems --- body
                 growth, immune system, and hepatic vitellogenin
                 transcription --- but we found little evidence for
                 significant negative relations (trade-offs) between the
                 three systems. This also applied to fish exposed to
                 combinations of the stressors. This high phenotypic
                 flexibility of trout in their resource allocation
                 suggests that linear resource allocations as mechanisms
                 of phenotypic plasticity may be too simplistic, but it
                 also may point to a greater capacity of ectothermic
                 than endothermic vertebrates to maintain key
                 physiological processes under competing resource needs
                 due to lower maintenance costs.",

                 fish farming. The meagre (\bioname{Argyrosomus regius})
                 arose as a promising species due to its fast growth
                 rates and flesh quality. Thus, it is currently being
                 produced in several Mediterranean countries, mainly in
                 sea-cages and salt-marshes. However, although meagre

                 waters, to date it is cultured in seawater. Here, we
                 show that juveniles may not successfully face either
                 freshwater or hyper-osmotic environments as high as 55
                 ppt salinity. We found that 55 ppt induced catabolism
                 and mobilization of energy metabolites stored in the
                 liver, probably to maintain its osmotic balance.
                 Furthermore, we found that osmoregulatory tissues such
                 as gills managed to maintain plasma osmolality levels
                 without differences in meagre acclimated at 5, 12 and
                 39 ppt salinity. Our results demonstrate the euryhaline
                 capacity of this species, highlighting that juveniles
                 may be cultured in a wider range of salinities rather
                 than just at seawater. Future studies should focus on

  abstract =     "Egg quality in fishes has been a topic of research in
                 aquaculture and fisheries for decades as it represents
                 an important life history trait and is critical for
                 captive propagation and successful recruitment. A major
                 factor influencing egg quality is proper yolk
                 formation, as most fishes are oviparous and the
                 developing offspring are entirely dependent on stored
                 egg yolk for nutritional sustenance. These maternally
                 derived nutrients consist of proteins, carbohydrates,
                 lipids, vitamins, minerals, and ions that are
                 transported from the liver to the ovary by lipoprotein
                 particles including vitellogenins. The yolk composition
                 may be influenced by broodstock diet, husbandry, and
                 other intrinsic and extrinsic conditions. In addition,
                 a number of other maternal factors that may influence
                 egg quality also are stored in eggs, such as gene
                 transcripts, that direct early embryonic development.
                 Dysfunctional regulation of gene or protein expression
                 may lead to poor quality eggs and failure to thrive
                 within hours of fertilization. These gene transcripts
                 may provide important markers as their expression
                 levels may be used to screen broodstock for potential
                 spawning success. In addition to such intrinsic
                 factors, stress may lead to ovarian atresia or
                 reproductive failure and can impact fish behavior,
                 fecundity, and ovulation rate. Finally, postovulatory
                 aging may occur when eggs become overripe and the fish
                 fails to spawn in a timely fashion, leading to low
                 fertility, often encountered during manual strip
                 spawning of fish.",

                 December 2016 to April 2017. A control sample was also
                 prepared in the laboratory with the same raw fish used
                 by the producers to compare the results. Gas
                 chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD)
                 was used to detect and quantify OCP residues. Six
                 samples out of 27 (about 22\%) were found to be

                 5.2 {\pm} 0.04 log cfu g {-1} for control samples.
                 Fungal count ranged from 3.2 {\pm} 0.04 log cfu g {-1}
                 to 3.5 {\pm} 0.04 log cfu g {-1}, 3.4 {\pm} 0.04 log

                 respectively. All the producer and retailer samples and
                 one-third of the control samples were found to be

                 begun in the fall and post-vitellogenic oocytes of 1250
                 {\mu}m were present between March and June. Males were
                 in spermiation condition and produced good-quality
                 sperm throughout the year, regardless of the
                 temperature profile to which they were exposed. Some
                 females completed oogenesis, underwent oocyte
                 maturation, and spawned spontaneously under both
                 constant and fluctuating temperatures. The sex steroid
                 hormones of both males and females followed the
                 already-known profiles during fish gametogenesis,
                 except for 17,20{\beta}-dihydroxy-progesterone, which
                 did not seem to be related to either female or male
                 maturation. The female reproductive dysfunctions that
                 were identified included (a) the arrest of oogenesis at
                 the cortical alveoli stage in certain females; (b) the
                 failure to undergo oocyte maturation in others; and (c)
                 the production of large percentages of unfertilized
                 eggs from the females that spawned spontaneously. Our
                 study suggests that reproduction in captivity is
                 possible in wreckfish maintained under typical marine
                 aquaculture conditions, but that reliable spawning and
                 production of high-quality eggs may require some years
                 of adaptation to captivity, before the reproductive
                 dysfunctions will be overcome.",

                 and poses a constraint for the development of farming
                 of new species. In 2017, Siberian sturgeon
                 (\bioname{Acipenser baerii}) juveniles were imported
                 from Italy to a Swedish farm. Transport conditions were
                 suboptimal. Thirty percent died during transport and
                 within the first days after arrival. Ten days after
                 arrival, mortalities started to occur again, which
                 prompted initiation of an investigation into the
                 mortalities. Diseased fish were transported live to the
                 National Veterinary Institute (SVA) for necropsy and
                 further analysis. Pathological and histopathological
                 investigation was conducted. Virology was performed on
                 gills and internal organs by cell culture isolation and
                 using specific PCR protocols against nervous necrosis
                 virus (NNV) and Acipenser iridovirus European (AcIV-E).
                 The juveniles displayed neurological signs such as
                 lethargy, inability to maintain an upright position,
                 and erratic swimming. Body condition was below normal,
                 and gills were pale. One fish had petechial hemorrhages
                 on the abdomen and the snout. Two specimens had
                 intestinal hyperemia. Ventricles were air-filled, and
                 swim bladders were deflated. Viral cell cultures gave
                 negative results, but PCR analysis of gills and
                 internal organs detected the presence of AcIV-E. We
                 conclude that AcIV-E was associated with disease and
                 high mortality in the sturgeon juveniles, and stress
                 probably aggravated the course of the infection.",

                 importance of fish reintroduction for conservation
                 purposes, little is known about its efficiency. Here,
                 we assessed the viability of reintroduction of the
                 endangered migratory fish, Brycon orbignyanus, in an
                 area of the Upper Uruguay River basin where the species
                 has not been reported for more than 30 years. We
                 released 4000 yearling juveniles in the Pelotas River
                 in 2014 and maintained 400 juveniles in captivity as a
                 control population. After three years, a total of 13
                 individuals was recaptured, of which, 10 were
                 considered sexually mature with first maturation being
                 recorded in animals larger than 42 cm in total body
                 length. The age--length comparison with a control
                 population growth curve showed that recaptured fish
                 were slightly bigger than those in captivity.
                 Furthermore, important ecological attributes as
                 schooling behavior and dispersal capacity were recorded
                 for all recaptured individuals. Combined, our results
                 suggest that the re-establishment of a self-sustained
                 population of locally extinct species B. orbignyanus in
                 the Pelotas River may be successful if sustained over

  abstract =     "This study investigated whether compensatory growth
                 causes long-term effects in relative brain- or
                 intestine size in a wild, predominantly anadromous,
                 population of brown trout (\bioname{Salmo trutta}). The
                 subject fish belonged to two treatment groups; one
                 group had undergone starvation and subsequent growth
                 compensation, while the other were unrestricted
                 controls. The main hypothesis that compensatory growth
                 would negatively affect brain and intestinal size, as a
                 consequence of growth trade-offs during the
                 compensatory phase, could not be supported as no
                 significant differences were detected between the
                 treatment groups. Further exploratory analyses
                 suggested that males and females started to diverge in
                 both brain and intestine size at around 130 mm fork
                 length, with females developing relatively smaller
                 brains and larger intestines. The size at which the
                 differences appear is a typical size for smoltification
                 (saltwater preadaptation), and females tend to smoltify
                 to a higher proportion than males. Smoltification is
                 known to cause a more elongated morphology and
                 relatively smaller heads in salmonids, and the marine
                 lifestyle is associated with rapid growth, which could
                 require relatively larger intestines. Hence, these
                 emerging sex differences could be a consequence of
                 sex-biased smoltification rates. An investigation of
                 wild smolts of both sexes indicated no differences in
                 brain or intestine mass between male and female
                 smolts.",

  abstract =     "Environmental enrichment, or the enhancement of an
                 animal's surroundings when in captivity to maximise its
                 wellbeing, has been increasingly applied to fish
                 species, particularly those used commercially.
                 Laboratory species could also benefit from enrichment,
                 but it is not always clear what constitutes an enriched
                 environment. The zebrafish, \bioname{Danio rerio}, is
                 used widely in research and is one of the most
                 commonly-used laboratory animals. We investigated
                 whether changing the structural complexity of housing
                 tanks altered the behaviour of one strain of zebrafish.
                 Fish were kept in three treatments: (1) very enhanced
                 (VE); (2) mildly enhanced (ME); and (3) control (CT).
                 Level of aggression, fertilisation success, and growth
                 were measured at regular intervals in a subset of fish
                 in each treatment group. The VE fish were more
                 aggressive over time than either ME or CT fish, both in
                 the number of attacks they made against a mirror image
                 and in their tendency to stay close to their reflection
                 rather than avoid it. Furthermore, VE fish were shorter
                 than CT fish by the end of the experiment, though mass
                 was not significantly affected. There was no
                 significant effect of treatment on fertilisation
                 success. These findings suggest that the way in which
                 fish are housed in the laboratory can significantly
                 affect their behaviour, and potentially, their growth.
                 The zebrafish is a shoaling species with a dominance
                 hierarchy, and so may become territorial over objects
                 placed in the tank. The enrichment of laboratory tanks
                 should consider aspects of the species' behaviour.",

  abstract =     "Cannibalism occurs in many cultured fish species,
                 especially at the larval and juvenile stages of
                 piscivorous taxa. In farmed percid species, such as
                 pikeperch (\bioname{Sander lucioperca}), intra-cohort
                 cannibalism is a major issue inducing significant
                 losses of the initial stocking density during the first
                 weeks of rearing. Therefore, the present study was
                 designed to investigate the effects of perch larvae
                 (\bioname{Perca fluviatilis}) as live prey on growth,
                 survival and cannibalism in pikeperch larvae under

                 behavioural variables linked to aggressiveness (S
                 postures, attacks, bites and ingestion), and group
                 structures were considered. The survival rate was not
                 different between the two groups (72\% with prey vs.
                 69\% without prey), but the cannibalism rate was higher
                 in the group with the prey (28\% vs. 10\%). The means
                 of final weight and length of pikeperch larvae were
                 higher in the group fed with perch larvae, but size
                 heterogeneity measured by the coefficients of variation
                 for these two parameters did not differ. The specific
                 growth rate was higher in the group fed with perch
                 larvae, but there was no difference between the two
                 groups concerning Fulton's condition factor. Among all
                 the behavioural variables (aggressiveness, group
                 structure), none differed between the two groups.",

  abstract =     "Ionic homeostasis is an essential component of
                 functioning cells, and ionic stress imposed by
                 excessive salinity can disrupt cellular and
                 physiological processes. Therefore, increasing salinity
                 of aquatic environments---a consequence of global
                 climate change---has the potential to adversely affect
                 the health of aquatic animals and their ecosystems. The
                 ability to respond adaptively to adverse environmental
                 changes is essential for the survival of species, but
                 animals in early embryonic stages may be particularly
                 vulnerable, as they cannot easily escape from such
                 conditions. Herein, the effects of increasing salinity
                 on the mortality and hatching time of zebrafish
                 (\bioname{Danio rerio}) embryos were investigated.
                 Increasing salinity significantly affected mortality
                 after 24 h of exposure beginning from {$<$2} h
                 post-fertilisation, with 10 parts per thousand (ppt)
                 inducing complete lethality. The 24-h LC50 of NaCl to
                 embryos was estimated to be approximately 5.6 ppt.
                 Interestingly, 5 ppt, a test concentration only
                 slightly lower than the LC50, induced earlier hatching
                 than at lower concentrations. This earlier hatching was
                 also observed even when exposure was commenced at later
                 stages of embryogenesis, despite later-stage embryos
                 not suffering appreciable mortality in response to
                 salinity. The results suggest that earlier hatching is
                 a plastic response which may function to enable embryos
                 to evade unfavourable conditions.",

                 readily entered both blood and intestinal leukocytes.
                 Superoxide anion production and phagocytosis were
                 decreased by low doses of CSE and increased with high
                 doses. CSE and GA differently regulated cytokine
                 expression in blood and intestinal leukocytes. High
                 doses of CSE upregulated IL-1{\beta}, TNF-{\alpha}, and
                 IL-10 in intestinal leukocytes and IL-10 in blood

                 very little is known regarding the fate of hatchery

                 non-native rainbow trout, \bioname{Salvelinus

                 place on the Cherokee Qualla Boundary in North
                 Carolina, a location with one of the highest riverine
                 stocked trout densities in the eastern {United States}.
                 During May 2017, 10 waterproof cameras were deployed
                 for 1-hour intervals on each carcass twice daily for a

                 only 24.7\% visited by crayfish, with a maximum of 9
                 and a mean of 1.93 for N. micropogon. Half of the
                 carcasses were removed within 2 days. Based on natural

                 Until now, genomic or transcriptomic information for
                 any species within the genus Polyprion has either
                 remained unpublished or is non-existent. Using Illumina

                 developmental stage-specific variations underlying

                 related with several side-effects on marine fish
                 performance, health, or disease resistance. Physical
                 barriers of the skin, gills, and gut constitute the
                 primary defense mechanism of fish. Skin mucus mucosal

                 physical, chemical, and protective characteristics of
                 skin mucus. Very little is known about the influence of
                 diet composition on fish skin mucus fatty acid profile.
                 Gilthead sea bream skin mucus contained 10\% of total
                 lipids (TL), which consisted of 50--60\% neutral (NL)

                 was the main LC-PUFA stored in skin mucus (14\% TL) in

                 parasitic nematodes of the family Anisakidae, of which
                 the species belonging to \bioname{Anisakis simplex}
                 complex are the most representative. It is considered
                 an emerging disease in Spain. The objective of this
                 study is to analyse the presence of larvae in fish
                 frequently consumed in Spanish supermarkets, inferring
                 the risk of infection. In total 1,786 specimens of 9
                 different fish species, from two geographical origins
                 (Atlantic and Mediterranean), acquired fresh and not
                 eviscerated were examined for anisakid nematodes.
                 Analysis showed that 33.7\% of the samples were
                 parasitized by Anisakis larvae. The horse mackerel
                 (\bioname{Trachurus trachurus}) presented the highest
                 total prevalence (66.0\%), followed by the silver hake
                 (\bioname{Merluccius bilinearis}) (59.5\%), the
                 mackerel (\bioname{Scomber scombrus}) (58.4\%), the
                 blue whiting (\bioname{Micromesistius poutassou})
                 (53.9\%) and the European hake (Merlucius merlucius)
                 (45.0\%). In general, the prevalence was higher in
                 Atlantic than in Mediterranean fish. In all the species
                 analysed, a higher presence of the parasite was
                 detected in the viscera than in the flesh, although in
                 the most parasitized species a noteworthy prevalence
                 and abundance was observed in the flesh. In conclusion,
                 risk factors, like fish species and origin, should be
                 considered by consumers, in addition of following the

                 try to sell the new species in their firms' domestic
                 markets, but they might also look at other markets.
                 However, as markets are becoming more global and
                 competitors more international, considering
                 internationalization may be a necessity rather than a

                 different internationalization strategies (i.e.

                 waterfall strategy refers to the sequential

                 the sprinkler strategy concerns the simultaneous
                 introduction of a product in multiple international
                 markets. Since a sprinkler approach requires many
                 resources and the ability to quickly ramp up production
                 capacity, a waterfall approach appears more suitable
                 for farmers of greater amberjack. Italy and Spain

  abstract =     "Among the many anthropogenic chemicals that end up in
                 the aquatic ecosystem, heavy metals, in particular
                 cadmium, are hazardous compounds that have been shown
                 to affect developmental, reproductive, hepatic,
                 hematological, and immunological functions in teleost
                 fish. There is also evidence that cadmium disturbs bone
                 formation and skeletal development, but data is scarce.
                 In this work, zebrafish was used to further
                 characterize the anti-osteogenic/osteotoxic effects of
                 cadmium and gain insights into underlying mechanisms.
                 Upon exposure to cadmium, a reduction of the opercular
                 bone growth was observed in 6-days post-fertilization
                 (dpf) larvae and an increase in the incidence of
                 skeletal deformities was evidenced in 20-dpf
                 post-larvae. The extent and stiffness of newly formed
                 bone was also affected in adult zebrafish exposed to
                 cadmium while regenerating their caudal fin. A pathway
                 reporter assay revealed a possible role of the MTF-1
                 and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways in mechanisms of
                 cadmium osteotoxicity, while the expression of genes
                 involved in osteoblast differentiation and matrix
                 production was strongly reduced in cadmium-exposed
                 post-larvae. This work not only confirmed cadmium
                 anti-osteogenic activity and identified targeted
                 pathways and genes, but it also suggested that cadmium
                 may affect biomechanical properties of bone.",

                 least square means or marginal means. The results
                 showed that the index was heavily influenced by the
                 year and quarter, but it did not relate to the vessel's
                 capacity. While the CPUE series fluctuated greatly, it
                 showed a declining trend over the years of
                 observation.",

  abstract =     "Global consumption of seafood is steadily increasing,
                 as is the variety of seafood, including dishes with raw
                 or undercooked fish, leading to an increased risk of
                 seafood-borne parasitic diseases. To address today's
                 challenges to understand the biology and ecology of
                 these parasites in an ever-changing environment and to
                 tackle their pathogenicity, multidisciplinary research
                 is needed. In addition, the gap between research and
                 stakeholders must be bridged to decrease the risk these
                 parasites pose to public health. A ``One-Health''
                 approach to research is necessary to ensure that
                 consumers, aquatic animals, and environmental health
                 questions are assessed in an integrated and holistic
                 manner, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding
                 of the issues associated with seafood-borne parasitic
                 diseases and potential solutions. However, when it
                 comes to seafood-borne parasitic diseases, there is
                 limited guidance available for a ``One-Health''
                 approach since these diseases can be less known. In
                 this article, the focus is on parasitic diseases caused
                 by seafood, which have been less studied even in some
                 developed countries where seafood is popular. A brief
                 overview of some of the seafood-borne parasitic
                 diseases is provided followed by the significance of
                 the awareness among various stakeholders in a country.
                 In this article, it is argued that researchers and
                 stakeholders are closely connected and a knowledge gap
                 in one can result in a gap in knowledge and awareness
                 in the other, causing an inability to accurately
                 estimate the issues caused by these parasites. It is
                 suggested that raising awareness, supporting research
                 and training of all stakeholders are crucial for the
                 prevention of seafood-borne parasitic diseases and the
                 protection of the health of seafood consumers.",

                 refinement that will ensure the good condition of
                 animals used in experimentation. The present study
                 investigated the impact of invasive procedures on the
                 patterns of movement of zebrafish (\bioname{Danio
                 rerio}). Recordings were made before and after fin
                 clipping, PIT tagging and a standard pain test and
                 these were compared with control and sham handled
                 zebrafish. The fractal dimension (FD) from the 3D
                 trajectories was calculated to determine the effect of
                 these treatments on the complexity of movement
                 patterns. While the FD of zebrafish trajectories did
                 not differ over time in either the control or sham
                 group, the FDs of the treatment groups reduced in
                 complexity. The FD of fish injected with different
                 strengths of acetic acid declined in a dose-dependent
                 manner allowing us to develop an arbitrary scale of
                 severity of the treatments. The 3D trajectory plots
                 from some groups indicated the presence of repetitive
                 swimming patterns akin to stereotypical movements. When
                 administered with lidocaine, which has analgesic
                 properties, the movement complexity of fin clipped fish
                 reverted to a pattern that resembled that of control
                 fish. Fractal analysis of zebrafish locomotion could
                 potentially be adopted as a tool for fish welfare

  abstract =     "Coastal predatory fish are of key importance for the
                 provisioning of ecosystem services in the Baltic Sea.
                 Worldwide, however, there has been a general and sharp
                 decline in predatory fish populations, in turn
                 threatening the viability and function of marine
                 ecosystems. On the basis of the literature, the past
                 (data until the 2000s) and current (data until early
                 and mid 2010s) trends in abundance of coastal predatory
                 fish in the Baltic Sea are reviewed in this paper.
                 Potentially important impacting factors behind the
                 temporal development of the populations and measures to
                 strengthen and restore them are also discussed.
                 Available data from coastal fish monitoring programs
                 suggest a stable or increasing abundance of coastal
                 predatory fish as a functional group and for the
                 species perch in the majority of areas assessed in the
                 Baltic Sea. For pike and pikeperch, data to support
                 assessments is scarce, but suggest substantial declines
                 in the abundance of both species in most assessed
                 areas. The impacting factors behind these patterns vary
                 between species and areas, but include climate, habitat
                 exploitation, fishing, and species-interactions in the
                 coastal food web. Measures to restore and support
                 coastal predatory fish communities should follow an
                 ecosystem-based approach to management and include
                 efforts to regulate fisheries sectors in combination
                 with habitat protection and restoration.",

                 During the first two years of life, the meagre
                 evidences a certain grade of euryhalinity by staying in
                 brackish waters close to the shore. The aim of the
                 present study was to establish if fingerling growth in
                 brackish water is improved compared to seawater, where
                 current culture procedures are conducted.
                 Three-month-old fingerlings were maintained for 45 days

                 Several growth parameters as well as osmoregulatory and

                 concentrations ({$<$10} (P0), 40, 80, 120 mg L {-1}) in
                 rearing water on growth performance, feed efficiency,
                 and welfare traits of juvenile African catfish
                 (\bioname{Clarias gariepinus} Burchell, 1822). By
                 trend, optimum specific growth rate of 2.66\% d {-1}
                 and feed conversion ratio of 0.71 were observed at 40
                 and 80 mg L {-1} PO 4 {3-} -P. Higher PO 4 {3-} -P
                 significantly affected skin coloration, swimming
                 activity and external injuries, with the palest and
                 inactive fish combined with most external injuries in
                 the P120 group. Mineral and protein contents in the
                 fish remained unaffected, while fat content inside the
                 fillets enriched with increasing PO 4 {3-} -P.
                 Inorganic P in blood plasma increased significantly,
                 while phosphate concentrations inside the fillet
                 remained unchanged. We suggest that PO 4 {3-} -P
                 concentrations of 40 to 80 mg L {-1} do not reduce the
                 performance of African catfish aquaculture, while
                 increased values of 120 mg L {-1} affect fish welfare.
                 This allows limited addition of PO 4 {3-} -P fertilizer
                 in coupled aquaponics with African catfish to support
                 plant growth.",

                 studied mucosal organs in fish. These mucosal
                 structures provide the intimate interface between the
                 internal and external milieus and serve as the
                 indispensable first line of defense. They have highly
                 diverse physiological functions. Their role in defense
                 can be highlighted in three shared similarities: their
                 microanatomical structures that serve as the physical
                 barrier and hold the immune cells and the effector
                 molecules; the mucus layer, also a physical barrier,
                 contains an array of potent bioactive molecules; and
                 the resident microbiota. Mucosal surfaces are
                 responsive and plastic to the different changes in the
                 aquatic environment. The direct interaction of the
                 mucosa with the environment offers some important
                 information on both the physiological status of the
                 host and the conditions of the aquatic environment.
                 Increasing attention has been directed to these
                 features in the last year, particularly on how to
                 improve the overall health of the fish through
                 manipulation of mucosal functions and on how the
                 changes in the mucosa, in response to varying
                 environmental factors, can be harnessed to improve
                 husbandry. In this short review, we highlight the
                 current knowledge on how mucosal surfaces respond to
                 various environmental factors relevant to aquaculture
                 and how they may be exploited in fostering sustainable
                 fish farming practices, especially in controlled

  abstract =     "Viviparity in teleosts involves, invariably, the ovary
                 in a gestational role. This type of viviparity is due
                 to the combination of unique aspects, different from
                 those found in the rest of vertebrates. These aspects
                 are: the ovary has a saccular structure; the germinal
                 epithelium lines the ovarian lumen; the absence of
                 oviducts; and the intraovarian insemination,
                 fertilization, and gestation. The communication of the
                 germinal zone of the ovary to the exterior is via the
                 caudal zone of the ovary---the gonoduct. The germinal
                 epithelium is composed of oogonia and oocytes scattered
                 individually or in cell nests among somatic epithelial
                 cells. In the ovarian stroma the follicles are included
                 which are formed by the oocyte, which is surrounded by
                 follicular cells and the vascularized theca. The
                 oogenesis comprises three stages: chromatin-nucleolus,
                 previtellogenesis, and vitellogenesis. There is no
                 ovulation, as the oocyte is retained in the follicle.
                 During the insemination, the spermatozoa enter into the
                 ovarian lumen and the intrafollicular fertilization
                 occurs, followed by intrafollicular gestation. The
                 intraovarian gestation of poeciliids involves
                 morphological characteristics associated with the
                 intrafollicular embryogenesis and types of nutrition,
                 such as lecithotrophy and matrotrophy. In
                 lecithotrophy, the nutrients come from the yolk
                 reserves stored during oogenesis, whereas in
                 matrotrophy the nutrients are provided by supplies from
                 maternal tissues to the embryo during gestation. The
                 maternal--embryonic metabolic interchanges converge
                 through the development of the association of maternal
                 and embryonic blood vessels, establishing a follicular

                 assess differences between two types of traps for adult
                 sea lamprey (\bioname{Petromyzon marinus}),
                 submerged-funnel traps and studded-tile traps, which
                 are angled ramps with trickle flow leading out of the
                 water. The studded-tile trap at one river caught about
                 50\% more females than the funnel trap. It caught males
                 that had a smaller body size and females with a lower
                 gonado-somatic index (GSI). The likelihood of catching
                 lamprey in the studded-tile trap increased after they
                 had been caught once. This was not the case for the
                 funnel traps, which are used for mark--recapture-based
                 population assessment of invasive sea lamprey in the
                 Great Lakes. The apparent trap response caused by
                 studded-tile traps may have been caused by a behavioral
                 bias, i.e., the traps consistently attracting a subset
                 of the population. Use of the studded-tile trap for
                 population assessment should only be considered after
                 more is known about its recapture bias. The differences
                 between lamprey caught in the two trap types suggests
                 that a variety of trapping methods needs to be employed

  abstract =     "Alaska's salmon fisheries are one of the more
                 intensely managed natural resources in the world. The
                 state's salmon fisheries support recreational,
                 subsistence, and commercial harvest with multiple
                 billions of dollars flowing into the economy, and
                 define the cultural identity of many Alaskans. Fishery
                 management practices rely on historic records to set
                 policies with two goals: to meet salmon escapement
                 quota and to maximize salmon harvest. At the same time,
                 rapid social and ecological changes to the sub-Arctic
                 are already impacting salmon runs and fisheries
                 management. Combined with the inability of fishery
                 managers to test the outcome of proposed policy
                 changes, an understanding of the role social and
                 ecological drivers play in harvest and effort is
                 required. To address the two-forked problem of
                 understanding socio-ecological dynamics and potential
                 policy responses to ecological and social changes, we
                 (1) conducted stakeholder workshops to solicit key
                 system drivers, (2) built an integrated agent based
                 model (ABM) of the system's socio-ecological dynamics,
                 and (3) tested the impacts of alternative future
                 scenarios of ecological, social, and policy changes on
                 the system's outcomes. We previously constructed and
                 validated a high-fidelity, data-driven, agent-based
                 model of the Kenai River, Alaska that simulates
                 seasonal harvest of sockeye and {Chinook} salmon, the
                 fishing activities of the personal use fishery,
                 commercial drift, and set gillnet agents. We study the
                 role of key stakeholder and ecological drivers, using
                 the ABM decision support tool, and their implications
                 for fisheries management policies. Analysis of the
                 scenario based studies found resilience in management
                 of commercial fisheries to changing salmon migration
                 dynamics, a lack of adaptive capacity in recreational
                 (personal use) dipnet users to altered sockeye salmon
                 runs, and the possible utility of introducing
                 management measures in the dipnet fishery to manipulate
                 sockeye escapement levels. These findings represent the
                 usefulness of this type of ABM in assisting fishery
                 managers everywhere in investigating possible future
                 outcomes of different management or ecological
                 scenarios.",

                 standard deviation (SD); 2.6 $ \times $ 10 5 {\pm} 0.6
                 $ \times $ 10 5 cells mL {-1}), while the remaining
                 half were exposed to the non-toxic alga Rhodomonas
                 salina (median {\pm} SD; 3.2 $ \times $ 10 5 {\pm} 0.7
                 $ \times $ 10 5 cells mL {-1}). During exposure to
                 severe hypoxia, all of the fish were able to maintain
                 oxygen consumption by increasing the ventilation
                 volume. The results from fish that were exposed to P.
                 parvum showed a significant decrease in oxygen
                 extraction (median {\pm} SD; 52.6 {\pm} 6.9 percentage
                 points) from pre-exposure to the end of the experiment,
                 as opposed to fish exposed to R. salina, which were
                 unaffected. These results indicate that suffocation
                 affects the European plaice when exposed to P. parvum.
                 The observed severe decrease in oxygen extraction can
                 be ascribed to either damage of the gill epithelia or
                 increased mucus secretion on the gills, as both would
                 limit the transfer of oxygen, and both have been
                 observed.",

  abstract =     "Traditional animal welfare paradigms have focused on
                 maintaining physical health and mitigating negative
                 impacts to wellbeing. Recently, however, the field has
                 increasingly recognized the importance of positive
                 welfare (i.e., mental and physical states that exceed
                 what is necessary for immediate survival) and
                 accordingly introduced manipulations and indicators of
                 positive welfare for use in agriculture, laboratories,
                 and zoos/aquaria. The creation and monitoring of
                 positive welfare requires an in-depth knowledge of
                 species-specific behavior and biology, which
                 necessitates species-specific or, at a minimum,
                 taxa-specific standards. Research on positive welfare
                 in fish is lagging in this regard and therefore merits
                 further consideration. In this paper, we aim to merge
                 what is already known about positive welfare with the
                 existing fish behavior literature to develop a plan of
                 action for fish welfare research that will ultimately
                 contribute to the development of positive welfare
                 standards and assessment strategies for fish. We begin
                 by exploring the origins of positive welfare research
                 and then outline the physical, psychological and
                 species-specific areas of inquiry that can be
                 investigated in fish. In addition to presenting current
                 findings on fish motivation, emotion, potential sources
                 of positive welfare such as fulfillment of motivational
                 urges (establishing agency, engaging in exploration and
                 learning), and play behavior, we also identify
                 promising areas for future research aimed at developing
                 accurate and appropriate indicators of positive welfare
                 in fish.",

  abstract =     "Fish welfare is an essential issue that needs to be
                 tackled by the aquaculture industry. In order to
                 address it, studies have been limited to a small number
                 of species and the information is generally scattered.
                 In order to have a consistent overview of the welfare
                 of farmed fishes, we present the FishEthoBase, an
                 open-access database that ultimately aims to provide
                 information on the welfare of all fish species
                 currently farmed worldwide. Presently with 41 species,
                 this database is directed to all stakeholders in the
                 field and targets not only to bridge the gaps between
                 them but also to provide scientific information to
                 improve the welfare of fish. The current text explains
                 the database and presents an analysis of the welfare
                 scores of 41 species, suggesting that (i) the general
                 welfare state of farmed fishes is poor, (ii) there is
                 some potential for improvement and (iii) this potential
                 is related to research on species' needs, but (iv)
                 there are many remaining knowledge gaps and (v) current
                 fish farming technologies do not seem to fully address
                 welfare issues. The existence of a framework, such as
                 the FishEthoBase, is proposed as fundamental to the
                 design of strategies that improve the welfare of farmed

  abstract =     "The movement of fish can be regulated by behavioural
                 manipulation through non-physical barrier systems.
                 Aquatic invasive species are becoming one of the major
                 management issues in North America, and threaten native
                 aquatic ecosystems, including freshwater fish.
                 Placements of non-physical barriers in waterways can
                 help disrupt the movement of invasive fish. This study
                 examined the effect of a strobe-light stimulus on the
                 avoidance behaviour of two proxy species, juvenile
                 common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus carpio}) and juvenile
                 channel catfish (\bioname{Ictalurus punctatus}), in a
                 controlled laboratory environment. For each species,
                 three sequential treatments of pre-stimulus,
                 strobe-light stimulus, and post-stimulus for 30 min
                 periods were recorded on acclimated groups of 5
                 juvenile common carp and 5 juvenile channel catfish
                 using 15 and 13 replicates, respectively. The
                 distribution of juvenile common carp individuals
                 throughout the tank did not change significantly with
                 treatment, nor did cohesive grouping behaviour.
                 Similarly, there were no significant differences across
                 experimental treatments in average location/distance of
                 juvenile channel catfish relative to the strobe light
                 or degree of cohesion in response to the strobe light.
                 Non-physical barriers have been widely reported to vary
                 between species and environmental conditions. These
                 results suggest that strobe lights evoke no avoidance
                 or attractive responses in juvenile common carp and
                 juvenile channel catfish, and will likely not be an
                 effective barrier to inhibit movements of juvenile
                 invasive fishes.",

  abstract =     "Many species rely on acoustic communication to fulfil
                 several functions such as advertisement and mediation
                 of social interactions (e.g., agonistic, mating).
                 Therefore, fish calls can be an important source of
                 information, e.g., to recognize reproductive periods or
                 to assess fish welfare, and should be considered a
                 potential non-intrusive tool in aquaculture management.
                 Assessing fish acoustic activity, however, often
                 requires long sound recordings. To analyse these long
                 recordings automatic methods are invaluable tools to
                 detect and extract the relevant biological information.
                 Here we present a study to characterize meagre
                 (\bioname{Argyrosomus regius}) acoustic activity during
                 social contexts in captivity using an automatic
                 pattern-recognition methodology based on the Hidden
                 Markov Model. Calls produced by meagre during the
                 breading season showed a richer repertoire than
                 previously reported. Besides the dense choruses
                 composed by grunts already known for this species,
                 meagre emitted successive series of isolated pulses,
                 audible as `knocks'. Grunts with a variable number of
                 pulses were also registered. The overall acoustic
                 activity was concurrent with the number of spawning
                 events. A diel call rhythms exhibit peak of calling
                 activity from 15:00 to midnight. In addition, grunt
                 acoustic parameters varied significantly along the
                 reproduction season. These results open the possibility
                 to use the meagre vocal activity to predict breeding
                 and approaching spawning periods in aquaculture
                 management.",

                 hypothesis that the Silver Carp
                 (\bioname{Hypophthalmichthys molitrix}), an invasive
                 river carp from China, employs a prostaglandin F
                 2{\alpha} -derived sex pheromone that is attractive and
                 species-specific. Using electro-olfactogram recording
                 (EOG), we found that the olfactory system of this
                 species is acutely sensitive to three F-series
                 prostaglandins (PGFs) at picomolar concentrations and
                 that this sensitivity is enhanced when juveniles are
                 masculinized using androgens, consistent with
                 expectations of a sex pheromone. Individual PGFs had
                 behavioral activity but it was low, suggesting a
                 mixture might be important. To pursue this possibility,
                 we implanted carps with osmotic pumps containing
                 prostaglandin F 2{\alpha} (PGF 2{\alpha}), a treatment
                 previously shown to elicit release of a PGF-based
                 spawning pheromone in the Common Carp. We found that
                 PGF 2{\alpha} -implanted Silver Carp released a
                 species-specific odor that contained a blend of PGF
                 2{\alpha} and two of its metabolites, which
                 masculinized individuals detected and were attracted to
                 with high sensitivity. Finally, we found that a mixture
                 of these PGFs was attractive to masculinized Silver
                 Carp, while a different mixture released by Bighead
                 Carp was not. We conclude that Silver Carp likely use a
                 species-specific PGF 2{\alpha} -derived sex pheromone
                 that is probably released at spawning and might be
                 useful in its control. Confirmatory studies that
                 explore pheromone function in naturally mature Silver
                 Carp using natural odors in the field should now be
                 conducted to further confirm our proof-of-concept

                 semi-intensive aquaculture has led to a new welfare
                 approach to amyloodiniosis. There is already some

  abstract =     "Fish social behavior can be affected by artificial
                 environments, particularly by factors that act upon
                 species that show aggressive behavior to set social
                 rank hierarchy. Although aggressive interactions are
                 part of the natural behavior in fish, if constant and
                 intense, such interactions can cause severe body
                 injuries, increase energy expenditure, and lead the
                 animals to suffer from social stress. The immediate
                 consequence of these factors is a reduced welfare in
                 social fish species. In this paper, we consider the
                 factors that impact on the social behavior and welfare
                 of Nile tilapia, an African cichlid fish widely used
                 both in fish farms and in research; this species is
                 frequently used as a model for physiology and behavior
                 research. This is a polygynous species whose males
                 interact aggressively, establishing a territorial based
                 hierarchy, where a dominant male and several
                 subordinate males arise. When social stability is
                 shrunk, the negative effects of prolonged fighting
                 emerge. In this paper, we summarized how some of the
                 common practices in aquaculture, such as classifying
                 individuals by matching their sizes, water renewal,
                 stock density, and environment lighting affect Nile
                 tilapia social aggressive interactions and, in turn,
                 impact on its welfare. We also discuss some ways to
                 decrease the effects of aggressive interactions in Nile
                 tilapia, such as environment color and body tactile
                 stimulation.",

                 are widely used industrial chemicals, ubiquitously
                 present in the environment. While BPA is a well-known
                 endocrine disruptor and able to affect all levels of
                 the teleost reproductive axis, information regarding
                 TBBPA on this subject is very limited. Using primary
                 cultures from Atlantic cod (\bioname{Gadus morhua}),
                 the present study was aimed at investigating potential
                 direct effects of acute (72 h) BPA and TBBPA exposure
                 on cell viability and the expression of
                 reproductive-relevant genes in the pituitary. The
                 results revealed that both bisphenols stimulate cell
                 viability in terms of metabolic activity and membrane
                 integrity at environmentally relevant concentrations.
                 BPA had no direct effects on gonadotropin gene
                 expression, but enhanced the expression of
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor 2a, the
                 main gonadotropin modulator in Atlantic cod. In
                 contrast, TBBPA increased gonadotropin transcript
                 levels but had no effect on GnRH receptor mRNA. In
                 conclusion, both anthropogenic compounds display
                 endocrine disruptive properties and are able to
                 directly interfere with gene expression related to
                 reproductive function in cod pituitary cells at

                 passive integrated transponder (PIT)-Tags inserted into
                 the fish and PIT-Tag detection antennas at the fishway.
                 During several sampling events, 7113 barbel and nase
                 individuals were tagged and released at the point of
                 capture along the basin (2538 and 4575 of which were
                 tagged downstream and upstream, respectively). PIT-Tag
                 Detection Antennas close to the top and bottom of the
                 fishway monitored tagged fish continuously for 10
                 months (from March to December 2017), to analyze the
                 performance of the fishway. Upstream passage efficiency
                 was greater for barbel (60\% and 25\% for barbel and
                 nase, respectively). Differences in passage efficiency
                 between species may be due to differences in their
                 size. Mean length for barbels attempting to pass was
                 336 mm ({\pm}47 mm) while for nases was 143 mm ({\pm}26
                 mm). Moreover, both the number of attempts to pass and
                 ascend time for nases were higher than for barbels.
                 Entrance efficiency was low (3.5\% and 10.8\% for
                 barbel and nase, respectively), although 2017 was a
                 very dry year, thus these results are most likely
                 influenced by flow rates. Therefore, the fishway has
                 proved to be functional but is actually poor for
                 efficiency purposes, especially for small fish.",

                 determined using sectioned sagittal otoliths collected
                 from the Southeastern {United States} Atlantic coast
                 from 1979 to 2017. Opaque zones were annular, forming
                 between January and June for both species, with peaks
                 in occurrence of otoliths with opaque margins in April
                 for margate and March for black margate. The observed
                 ages for margate were 0--22 years, and the largest fish
                 measured 807 mm TL (total length). Black margate ranged
                 in age from 3 to 17 years, and the largest fish was 641
                 mm TL. Weight--length relationships were: margate,

                 a bias-correction procedure to account for the lack of
                 younger fish, growth was described by the equation L t
                 = 523 (1 {-} e {-0}.18(t+0.0001)). Age-invariant
                 estimates of natural mortality were M = 0.19 y {-1} and
                 M = 0.23 y {-1} for margate and black margate,

                 sedentary behavior, which depends on the animals' body
                 size, is unknown. Our objective was to analyze, for two
                 years, the changes in the home range of a population of
                 European eel (\bioname{Anguilla anguilla}, Linnaeus,
                 1758) in Southern Europe in relation to the animals'
                 body length (TL), and the influence of environmental
                 factors (water temperature and flow) on the local
                 movements of this population through observation of
                 their sedentary behavior. We used a
                 previously-validated mark--recapture methodology,
                 obtaining a low deviation in the estimation of the
                 extension of the eels' movements. Our results revealed
                 relatively short movements in relation to other
                 populations, and we hypothesize that this could be
                 related to the high habitat diversity and low eel
                 population density in the study area. The home range
                 size showed a high variability and dispersion among the
                 smallest eels, however, as TL increased, the
                 variability of home range size decreased, and home
                 ranges were larger. These changes could be associated
                 with the acquisition of a sedentary lifestyle. Once
                 eels had become sedentary, an environmental pattern was
                 observed between their movements and the water
                 temperature and flow, with larger movements observed as
                 the flow increased and water temperature decreased.
                 This suggests that the temporal and spatial scales of
                 observation are of crucial importance for monitoring
                 eel populations and for the study of population size
                 structure, population dynamics, and biology, which can
                 be used to improve conservation strategies.",

                 females fail to undergo oocyte maturation and spawn or
                 produce poor quality eggs. This study investigated
                 whether administration of a synthetic agonist of
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) could improve F1
                 h{\=a}puku spawning and complete the life-cycle in
                 captivity. Spawning trials were conducted over 2 years
                 in 2013 and 2014, when F1 were aged five and six years.
                 In 2013, females previously conditioned under a
                 variable or constant temperature regime were implanted
                 with GnRHa (100 {\mu}g/kg {-1}) or blank implants
                 constructed of powdered cellulose and cholesterol.
                 Spawning was erratic and egg quality very poor in all
                 tanks. No F2 offspring were produced by communal
                 spawning. In contrast, viable F2 larvae were produced
                 by strip-spawning and in vitro fertilization after a
                 series of GnRHa injections. In 2014, two additional
                 trials were conducted: females received ethylene-vinyl
                 acetate copolymer (EVAc) matrix implants containing
                 GnRHa (100 {\mu}g/kg {-1}) or blank implants and in the
                 second trial, two GnRHa doses (100 {\mu}g/kg {-1} and
                 50 {\mu}g/kg {-1}) were tested. Eggs were first
                 detected in all tanks 12--17 days post-implantation
                 when females received 100 $ \mu $ g/kg {-1} GnRHa
                 implants, but not in the lower dose or control tanks.
                 In summary, this study achieved induction of female

                 long-term ({$>$1} year) fishery surveys across various

                 cultural value of this species. Overall, evidence
                 suggests that N. unicornis is the most
                 commercially-valuable reef-associated fish species
                 across the insular Pacific. This notion, coupled with a
                 diverse representation of N. unicornis across Pacific

                 (FM) as a sustainable protein source in aquaculture
                 feed that does not negatively impact the marine
                 ecosystem. Despite housefly (Musca domestica) larvae
                 having adequacy of amino acid profiles, they have
                 sometimes been reported to be inferior to FM,
                 especially for marine carnivorous fish species. Here,
                 we report that the removal of the hydrophobic fractions
                 from housefly larvae enables significant replacement of
                 FM in the diet of the red seabream (\bioname{Pagrus
                 major}). In a feeding trial, housefly (HF) larvae that
                 had the hydrophobic fraction removed as a complete
                 substitution for 70\% FM produced satisfactory growth.
                 However, HF larvae that were supplemented with the
                 hydrophobic fraction resulted in significant growth
                 reduction. Growth recovery was incomplete by
                 supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and
                 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to undefatted HF larvae,
                 being equivalent to that of fatty acid content with a
                 control diet. Moreover, fish with a dietary intake of
                 catechol identified from the hydrophobic fraction of
                 the HF showed growth reduction and morphological
                 alterations in the intestine. Our findings indicate
                 that the hydrophobic fraction from HF larvae contains a
                 negative factor for fish growth and eliminating the
                 fraction from HF larvae is thought to be an important
                 process for sustainable aquaculture.",

                 gene expression increased in L25 whereas GHR-II, IGF-II
                 and MyoG were higher in L6. IGF-I and MSTN expression
                 was not affected by the different diets. Adipose IGF-I

                 weight and members of GH/IGF system in liver and

                 Correlations found in L10 group between both liver and
                 skeletal muscle GHR-I and IGF-I were lost in either L6

                 unbalanced dietary lipid contents (6\% and 25\%)
                 exhibit a compensatory regulation of systemic and local
                 components of the GH/IGF axis. Furthermore, the marked
                 inhibition of muscle MyoG gene expression in L25 might
                 limit excessive lipid deposition and fish growth. Our
                 data suggest that a dietary lipid contents of 10\%
                 would promote a particular adjustment of the endocrine
                 and autocrine/paracrine GH/IGF system, stimulating body
                 growth and perhaps muscle hyperplasia. On the other
                 hand, a higher dietary lipid content would uncouple the
                 GH/IGF system, reducing hepatic IGF-I, while slightly
                 increasing hepatic GHR-I, probably to prompt

                 containing about 50\% of the world's known fish species
                 but, ironically, are the most invaded ecosystems. In
                 Portuguese freshwaters, there are currently 20
                 identified non-native fishes, arriving at an
                 unprecedented rate of a new species every two years. A
                 recent non-native is the European catfish
                 \bioname{Silurus glanis}, a top predator native to
                 Central and Eastern Europe, that arrived at the Lower

                 strongly affected by changes in environmental
                 conditions, the influence of photoperiod and

                 well documented. In the present study, we determined
                 the diel variations in the basal activities of

                 skin mucus of Nile tilapia (\bioname{Oreochromis

                 equal length of day and night (12L:12D, LD) or total
                 darkness (0L:24D, DD). A second experiment was
                 conducted to determine how time-dependent (i.e., day
                 versus night) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge could
                 influence these skin mucosal defenses. The results
                 revealed that LD signal differentially modulated the
                 activities of mucosal immune molecules. Fish subjected
                 to LD regime showed significantly higher levels of skin
                 mucus lysozyme and protease at nighttime than at
                 daytime. This distinct feature was not observed in fish
                 under DD. There was no general mucosal response
                 patterns to time-dependent LPS challenge. Nonetheless,
                 protease and lysozyme, which were identified to be at
                 elevated levels at night, were significantly modulated
                 when the endotoxin was administered at nighttime.
                 Ceruloplasmin was the only molecule that responded to
                 LPS challenge at daytime, where its activity
                 significantly increased at 8 h post-stimulation.
                 Collectively, the results revealed that photoperiod
                 cues influenced the activities of mucosal defenses and
                 this may play, at least in part, in the temporal

                 season. The aim of this work was to study the effects
                 of low temperature and recovery from such exposure on
                 the pituitary activity of sea bream juveniles fed 18\%
                 or 14\% dietary lipid. A controlled indoor trial was
                 performed to simulate natural temperature fluctuation
                 (22 {$^\circ $}C to 14 {$^\circ $}C to 22 {$^\circ

                 the pituitary by analyzing the gene expression of some
                 pituitary hormones and hormone receptors via qPCR, as
                 well as plasma levels of thyroidal hormones. In
                 response to higher dietary lipids, hormone pituitary
                 expressions were up-regulated. Induced low temperatures

                 of the pituitary to recognize both external conditions
                 and to modulate its response accordingly. However,

                 Anabantidae fish, but also relevant to other
                 vertebrates. We analyzed the female blue gourami brain
                 transcriptome in two developmental stages:
                 pre-vitellogenesis (PVTL) before yolk accumulation in
                 the oocytes, and high vitellogenesis (HVTL) at the end
                 of yolk accumulation in the oocytes. RNA sequencing of
                 whole-brain transcriptome identified 34,368 unique
                 transcripts, 23,710 of which could be annotated by
                 homology with other species. We focused on the
                 transcripts showing significant differences between the
                 stages. Seventeen and fourteen annotated genes were
                 found to be upregulated in PVTL and HVTL, respectively.
                 Five nuclear transcripts, three of which contain the
                 homeobox domain (ARX, DLX5, CERS6), were upregulated in
                 PVTL. Additionally, several receptors previously known
                 to be involved in reproduction were identified, and
                 three of these, G-protein coupled receptor 54, Membrane
                 progesterone receptor epsilon, and
                 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone II receptor (GPCR, mPR,
                 and GnRHR) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR in
                 brain, pituitary, and ovary samples from PVTL and HVTL
                 stage females. Of these, GPCR was highly expressed in
                 the brain and pituitary as compared to the ovary in
                 both PVTL and HVTL. GnRHR was highly expressed in the
                 ovary compared to the brain and pituitary, and its
                 levels in the brain were significantly higher in PVTL
                 than HVTL. Brain mPR mRNA levels were likewise higher
                 in PVTL than HVTL. In conclusion, this study details
                 changes in the female blue gourami brain transcriptome
                 through yolk accumulation in the oocytes and identifies
                 key genes that may mediate this process.",

                 Genetic results indicated that ten males maintained
                 guardianship over their nest territories for up to nine
                 nest cycles during a 3.5 month period. Genotypes of

                 clutches) were consistent with 95\% of the offspring
                 being sired by the guardian male. Offspring lacking

                 maternal genotypes allowed the identification of a

                 ten territorial males. Males were polygynous, mating

                 Genetic data from nests, which consisted of up to four

                 development. To investigate the underlying causes,
                 levels of sex steroids (testosterone, T;
                 estradiol-17{\beta}, E2) and ovarian steroidogenic
                 enzyme mRNAs were compared between artificially
                 maturing Japanese eels and wild-caught, spontaneously
                 maturing New Zealand longfin eels. The latter were
                 employed as reference, as wild Japanese eels in
                 advanced stages of oogenesis are near-impossible to
                 catch. Serum T levels in artificially maturing Japanese
                 eel changed with stage in a pattern that was comparable
                 to that in longfin eels. Likewise, ovarian mRNA levels
                 of most steroidogenic enzyme genes were not
                 qualitatively dissimilar between both eel species when
                 taking developmental stage into account. However,
                 aromatase (cyp19a) mRNA levels, together with serum E2
                 levels, rapidly increased in artificially maturing
                 Japanese eels in mid-late stages of oogenesis
                 (gonadosomatic index, GSI = 13.8\%), whereas no such
                 increase was evident in longfin eels (GSI $ \approx $
                 6.9\%). In addition, sex steroid and target gene mRNA
                 levels fluctuated drastically with each hormone
                 injection. We contend that expression of most target
                 genes, possibly even that of cyp19a, during induced
                 oogenesis could be ``normal'', with the drastic
                 fluctuations due most likely to hormone delivery

  abstract =     "The regeneration of paired appendages in certain fish
                 and amphibian lineages is a well established and
                 extensively studied regenerative phenomenon. The
                 teleost fin is comprised of a proximal endoskeletal
                 part (considered homologous to the Tetrapod limb) and a
                 distal exoskeletal one, and these two parts form their
                 bony elements through different ossification processes.
                 In the past decade, a significant body of literature
                 has been generated about the biology of exoskeletal
                 regeneration in zebrafish. However, it is still not
                 clear if this knowledge can be applied to the
                 regeneration of endoskeletal parts. To address this
                 question, we decided to compare endo- and exoskeletal
                 regenerative capacity in zebrafish (\bioname{Danio
                 rerio}) and mudskippers (Periophthalmus barbarous). In
                 contrast to the reduced endoskeleton of zebrafish,
                 Periophthalmus has well developed pectoral fins with a
                 large and easily accessible endoskeleton. We performed
                 exo- and endoskeletal amputations in both species and
                 followed the regenerative processes. Unlike the almost
                 flawless exoskeletal regeneration observed in
                 zebrafish, regeneration following endoskeletal
                 amputation is often impaired in this species. This
                 difference is even more pronounced in Periophthalmus
                 where we could observe no regeneration in endoskeletal
                 structures. Therefore, regeneration is regulated
                 differentially in the exo- and endoskeleton of teleost
                 species.",

                 population of the Miramichi River, New Brunswick is

                 salmon (\bioname{Salmo salar}) numbers within that

                 depart from the Miramichi system during the striped

  abstract =     "Freshwater fish represent half of all fish species and
                 are the most threatened vertebrate group. Given their
                 considerable passion and knowledge, aquarium hobbyists
                 can play a vital role in their conservation. CARES is
                 made up of many organizations, whose purpose is to
                 encourage aquarium hobbyists to devote tank space to
                 the most endangered and overlooked freshwater fish to
                 ensure their survival. We found the CARES priority list
                 contains nearly six hundred species from twenty
                 families and two dozen extinct-in-the-wild species. The
                 major families were typically those with the largest
                 hobbyist affiliations such as killifish, livebearers,
                 and cichlids, the latter containing half of CARES
                 species. CARES included every IUCN threatened species
                 of Pseudomugilidae and Valenciidae, but only one
                 percent of threatened Characidae, Cobitidae, and
                 Gobiidae species. No Loricariidae in CARES were in the
                 IUCN red list as they have not been scientifically
                 described. Tanzania and Mexico contained the largest
                 amount of species, with the latter containing the most
                 endemics. Many species were classified differently than
                 the IUCN, including a third of extinct-in-the-wild
                 species classified as least concern by the IUCN. This
                 vast disconnect exemplifies the importance of future
                 collaboration and information exchange required between

                 20:00 (light off), 02:00, and again at 08:00 to

                 activity. IgM levels were higher during the day in
                 seabream and reached a minimum value at 20:00, but it
                 was hardly affected in sea bass. No significant

                 variation in seabream, but it was significantly lower
                 at 14:00 than during the rest of the cycle in sea bass.

  abstract =     "The caudal fin of teleost fish has become an excellent
                 system for investigating the mechanisms of epimorphic
                 regeneration. Upon amputation of the caudal fin, a mass
                 of undifferentiated cells, called blastema, proliferate
                 beneath the wound-epidermis and differentiate into
                 various cell types to faithfully restore the missing
                 fin structures. Here we describe a protocol that can be
                 used to isolate and culture blastema cells from
                 zebrafish. Primary cultures were initiated from 36 h
                 post-amputation (hpa) blastema and optimal cell growth
                 was achieved using L-15 medium supplemented with 5\%
                 fetal bovine serum in plates either coated with
                 fibronectin or uncoated. After seeding, zebrafish
                 blastema cells formed a uniform culture and exhibited
                 polygonal shapes with prominent nucleus, while various
                 cell types were also observed after few days in culture
                 indicating cell differentiation. Upon treatment with
                 all- trans retinoic acid, zebrafish blastema cells
                 differentiated into neuron-like and oligodendritic-like
                 cells. Immunocytochemistry data also revealed the
                 presence of mesenchymal and neuronal cells. The
                 availability of blastema cell cultures could contribute
                 to a better understanding of epimorphic regeneration by
                 providing a mean to investigate the mechanisms
                 underlying blastema cell differentiation. Furthermore,
                 this protocol is simple, rapid, and cost-efficient, and
                 can be virtually applied to the development of any fish
                 blastema cell culture.",

                 Atlantic coasts of the Americas. In the Mediterranean,
                 it appeared around 1949 and though that it is
                 established in East Mediterranean waters, relevant
                 studies are limited. The aim of the present study is to
                 report quantitative and qualitative data on the blue
                 crab's biology and ecology in its non-native range,
                 that are indispensable for management purposes.
                 Papapouli Lagoon is in Thermaikos Gulf and is
                 ecologically impacted by the blue crabs. Fyke nets with
                 a 20 mm mesh opening were soaked for 12 to 14 h during
                 each survey. Abiotic environmental parameters were
                 obtained. The length--weight relationships were
                 expressed by the equation W = aL b. The species'
                 ecological preferences at Papapouli Lagoon were
                 assessed with PERMANOVA analysis, using the abiotic
                 parameters as factors. Student's t -tests were used to
                 assess the differences between sexes. The sex ratio of
                 the blue crab's population was assessed by a Chi-square
                 ({\chi} 2) analysis. The sex ratio was found to be
                 1.28:1, in favour of males. The most dominant group
                 size of male blue crabs was the 61--70 mm of CL and
                 130--139 mm of CW. Also, the dominant size group of
                 female blue crabs was 60--69 mm of CL and 120--129 mm
                 CW. The maximum abundance of blue crabs was recorded at
                 a salinity range from 24{\SGMLpermil} to
                 25{\SGMLpermil} and the water temperature range was
                 from 26 to 28 {$^\circ $}C.",

                 coastlines due to more restrictive temperature

                 biodiversity decline. Legal regulations relating to the
                 prevention, control, or eradication of invasive species
                 should always be up-to-date, as the failure to
                 recognize the problem, lack of adequate scientific
                 information, or long legal intervals required to
                 prepare the legislation may result in irreversible,

                 monitoring of the species distribution and levels of
                 establishment, as well as detailed knowledge about its
                 biology to predict dissemination and viability under

                 knowledge on the distribution, physiology, and behavior
                 of A. facetus, and applied the toolkits FISK v2 and
                 AS-ISK to this species to evaluate whether the species
                 should be classified as invasive in Portugal. Field
                 data show high abundance of the species in most streams
                 and dominance in specific hotspots. The scores reached

                 with a high economic impact in gilthead sea bream
                 aquaculture. In this study, genetic estimates
                 associated with lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV)
                 disease susceptibility and growth were determined in
                 sea bream juveniles. Two fish batches (named batch 1
                 and batch 2) were built from mass spawning and reared
                 under industrial conditions until disease outbreak. At
                 the moment of the sampling (n = 500 specimens for each
                 batch), all animals had the typical LCDV lesions in the
                 skin. For phenotyping, animals were weighted and
                 photographed for image analysis (surface covered and
                 lesion intensity). LCDV DNA copies were quantified in
                 the liver by qPCR. Batch 1 had a higher surface covered
                 and lesion intensity than batch 2, and the body caudal
                 region was the lowest affected region in both batches.
                 The average LCDV DNA copies in liver were higher in the
                 batch 1 than batch 2, and they were positively
                 correlated with severity index (SI) categories (r 2 =
                 0.90--0.94). The total number of families evaluated
                 were 150 and 128 for batch 1 and batch 2, respectively,
                 with a high bias in offspring contribution by family
                 and broodstock. Heritabilities for weight and length
                 were 0.18 and 0.14 in batch 1 and 0.06 and 0.05 in
                 batch 2, respectively. Heritability for the number of
                 viral DNA copies was low ($<$0.08) in both batches.
                 Heritabilities for SI in binary scale were 0.32/0.33
                 and 0.21/0.24 (underlying liability/Bayesian approach)
                 for batch 1 and batch 2, respectively. Genetic
                 correlations were very high and positive when growth
                 traits (weight and length) or disease traits (LCDV DNA
                 copies and SI) were compared. In contrast, the genetic
                 correlations between growth and disease traits were
                 moderate--high and positive in the batch 1 but negative
                 in batch 2. These results indicate the genetic
                 selection for LCDV susceptibility and growth is
                 feasible in sea bream juveniles, although estimates are
                 highly dependent on the age. The information provided
                 is relevant to designing selective breeding programs in
                 sea bream.",

                 critical bottleneck for fish recruitment; therefore, it

                 their physiology for more sustainable management of
                 fisheries. Here, we investigated the effects of warming
                 (OW; +4 {$^\circ $}C) and acidification (OA; {\Delta}pH
                 = 0.5) on the heart and oxygen consumption rates,
                 metabolic enzymatic machinery---namely citrate synthase
                 (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and
                 {\ss}-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), of seabream
                 (\bioname{Sparus aurata}) larvae (fifteen days after
                 hatch). Oxygen consumption and heart rates showed a
                 significant increase with rising temperature, but
                 decreased with p CO 2. Results revealed a significant
                 increase of LDH activity with OW and a significant
                 decrease of the aerobic potential (CS and HOAD
                 activity) of larvae with OA. In contrast, under OA, the
                 activity levels of the enzyme LDH and the LDH:CS ratio
                 indicated an enhancement of anaerobic pathways.
                 Although such a short-term metabolic strategy may
                 eventually sustain the basic costs of maintenance, it
                 might not be adequate under the future chronic ocean
                 conditions. Given that the potential for adaptation to
                 new forthcoming conditions is yet experimentally
                 unaccounted for this species, future research is
                 essential to accurately predict the physiological
                 performance of this commercially important species

                 depleted wild finfish populations by supplementing them
                 with hatchery-raised fish. In Taiwan, silver sea bream
                 (\bioname{Rhabdosargus sarba}) is a predominant
                 commercial species involved in stock enhancement
                 projects. Although management agencies conduct stock
                 enhancement projects, there are a lot of private
                 releases without records. Stock enhancement is
                 performed by the private aquaculture sector without
                 accurate genetic records, potentially leading to
                 unintended consequences for wild populations. We
                 analyzed the genetics of 459 wild and 701
                 hatchery-reared specimens from nine batches produced by
                 various hatcheries. Wild and hatchery-reared samples
                 could be considered two separate clades by using a set
                 of stable and informative microsatellite markers
                 including type I (from gene introns and 3{\prime}UTR)
                 and type II markers (randomly picked up from genome).
                 Type I microsatellite markers could more sensitively
                 reflect the loss of genetic diversity more than type II
                 markers in the domestication process. All specimens
                 were considered native by using mtDNA COI and
                 microsatellites. The genetic composition of the wild
                 population is relatively simple, and the estimated low
                 contribution rate of the hatchery stock (1.3--10.9\%;
                 6--50/459) indicated a weak but significant genetic
                 effect of stock enhancement. Therefore, establishing
                 standards for the stock enhancement of silver sea bream
                 for more effective supplementation of wild populations
                 is imperative.",

                 and caused a precipitous decrease in abundance of
                 native Yellowstone cutthroat trout
                 \bioname{Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri}. Suppression
                 efforts (primarily gillnetting) initiated in 1995 did
                 not curtail lake trout population growth or lakewide
                 expansion. An adaptive management strategy was
                 developed in 2010 that specified desired conditions
                 indicative of ecosystem recovery. Population modeling
                 was used to estimate effects of suppression efforts on
                 the lake trout and establish effort benchmarks to
                 achieve negative population growth ({\lambda} {$<$} 1).
                 Partnerships enhanced funding support, and a scientific
                 review panel provided guidance to increase suppression
                 gillnetting effort to $>$46,800 100-m net nights; this
                 effort level was achieved in 2012 and led to a
                 reduction in lake trout biomass. Total lake trout
                 biomass declined from 432,017 kg in 2012 to 196,675 kg
                 in 2019, primarily because of a 79\% reduction in
                 adults. Total abundance declined from 925,208 in 2012
                 to 673,983 in 2019 but was highly variable because of
                 recruitment of age-2 fish. Overall, 3.35 million lake
                 trout were killed by suppression efforts from 1995 to
                 2019. Cutthroat trout abundance remained below target
                 levels, but relative condition increased, large
                 individuals ($>$ 400 mm) became more abundant, and
                 individual weights doubled, probably because of reduced
                 density. Continued actions to suppress lake trout will
                 facilitate further recovery of the cutthroat trout
                 population and integrity of the Yellowstone Lake

  abstract =     "Invasive pest species are recognized as one of the
                 important drivers of reduced global biodiversity. In
                 Australia, the 267 invasive plant, animal and microbial
                 species, established since European colonization in the
                 1770s, have been unequivocally declared the most
                 important threat to species diversity in this country.
                 One invasive pest, the common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus
                 carpio}), has been targeted in an integrated pest
                 management plan that might include cyprinid herpesvirus
                 3 (CyHV-3) as a potential biocontrol agent. The
                 species-specificity of the released virus (and of field
                 variants that will inevitably arise) has been assessed,
                 and the virus judged to be safe. It has also been
                 hypothesised that, because the virulence of the CyHV-3
                 will likely decline following release, the virus should
                 be used strategically: initially, the aim would be to
                 markedly reduce numbers of carp in naive populations,
                 and then some other, as yet uncertain, complementary
                 broad-scale control measure would knock-down carp
                 numbers even further. Brief results are included from
                 recent studies on the modelling of release and spread
                 of the virus, the ecological and social concerns
                 associated with virus release, and the restoration
                 benefits that might be expected following carp control.
                 We conclude that, while further work is required (on
                 the virus, the target species, environmental issues,
                 and especially the identification of a suitable
                 broad-scale complementary control measure), optimism
                 must prevail in order to ensure an eventual solution to
                 this important environmental problem.",

                 harvest and increased production costs, but also damage
                 producers' reputation. Traditionally, off-flavors have
                 been removed by depuration before harvesting. Rainbow

                 focused on the Kenai Peninsula and the municipality of

                 causes problems in Atlantic salmon (\bioname{Salmo
                 salar}) aquaculture in the Northern Hemisphere, because
                 infestations can result in both a loss of production
                 and in fish mortality. Several types of treatment have
                 been used to control louse infestations, but these have
                 seen varying success. The aim of this review is to
                 examine the efficacy and safety of commonly used
                 treatments (chemical, biological, mechanical, and
                 preventive measures) as documented in peer-reviewed
                 publications. Efficacy is assessed in relation to a
                 reduction in numbers of lice, and safety is assessed as
                 a lack of negative treatment-associated effects on fish
                 health and welfare (Atlantic salmon and/or cleaner
                 fish). Most chemical treatments showed decreasing
                 efficacy over time, together with the use of increasing
                 concentrations as a result of the development of
                 resistance to the treatments by lice. The need for a
                 restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment
                 efficacy has been emphasized. The use of cleaner fish
                 was suggested to be effective, with few or no negative
                 effects towards Atlantic salmon. The use of cleaner
                 fish would be preferable to chemical treatment if the
                 farmed fish health and welfare criteria are met. At
                 present, the number of peer-reviewed publications
                 relating to other forms of treatment and prevention are

                 sound way in fishponds by applying integrated

                 waste recycling can help to protect the environment
                 from pollution and improve fishpond yields.
                 Additionally, IAA provides an opportunity for

                 subsystems leading to higher overall farm economic

                 of amaranth wastes (AW) as a dietary ingredient for
                 tilapia in a tilapia-amaranths integrated system (ITA).
                 An experimental diet (AD) contained 10\% (based on the
                 control diet, CD) inclusion of AW collected from a
                 nearby vegetable market. The experiments included
                 triplicate treatments with; (i) fish fed on AD, where
                 the pond water was used for irrigating the amaranth
                 plants (IAA-fish), and (ii) fish fed on CD, where no

                 (non-IAA fish). 90 days after fish stocking, eighteen 4
                 m 2 amaranth plots were prepared and treated with (i)
                 tap water without fertilization (control amaranths),

                 are spreading throughout the Mississippi River basin.
                 To explore the efficacy of a consumer-based market
                 (i.e., invasivorism) to manage them, we developed a
                 conceptual model and evaluated three harvest
                 approaches---direct contracted removal, volume-based
                 incentives (``fisher-side'' control), and set-quota
                 harvest (``market-side'' control). We quantified the
                 efficacy of these approaches and potential population
                 impact in the Illinois River. Contracted removal was
                 effective for suppressing small populations at the edge
                 of the range but cannot support a market.
                 ``Fisher-side'' removals totaled 225,372 kg in one
                 year. However, participation was low, perhaps due to
                 reporting requirements for fishers. The
                 ``market-side'', set-quota approach removed $>$1.3
                 million kg of bigheaded carp in less than 6 months.
                 Larger, older fish were disproportionately harvested,
                 which may hinder the ability to suppress population
                 growth. Total density declined in one river reach, and
                 harvest may reduce upstream movement toward the
                 invasion fronts. With sufficient market demand, harvest
                 may control bigheaded carp. However, lack of processing
                 infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks could
                 constrain harvest, particularly at low commodity
                 prices. Given the geographical scale of this invasion
                 and complicated harvest logistics, concerns about
                 economic dependence on invasivorism that encourage
                 stock enhancement are likely unmerited.",

                 important data for managers seeking to control invasive
                 grass carp populations. Ichthyoplankton tows for grass
                 carp eggs and larvae can be used to detect spawning
                 events; however, these samples can be highly
                 debris-laden, and are expensive and laborious to
                 process. An alternative method, environmental DNA
                 (eDNA) technology, has proven effective in determining
                 the presence of aquatic species. The objectives of this
                 project were to assess the use of eDNA collections and
                 quantitative eDNA analysis to assess the potential
                 spawning of grass carp in five reservoir tributaries,
                 and to compare those results to the more traditional
                 method of ichthyoplankton tows. Grass carp eDNA was
                 detected in 56\% of sampling occasions and was detected
                 in all five rivers. Concentrations of grass carp eDNA
                 were orders of magnitude higher in June, corresponding
                 to elevated discharge and egg presence. Grass carp
                 environmental DNA flux (copies/h) was lower when no
                 eggs were present and was higher when velocities and

                 positive relationship between grass carp eDNA flux and

  abstract =     "Alterations in gonad morphology are widespread in wild
                 fish populations. Whitefish (Coregonus spp.) from Lake
                 Thun, Switzerland, display a high prevalence of
                 macroscopical gonad malformations including fusions to
                 the musculature, segmented gonads and intersex
                 condition. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
                 whether the gonad morphological changes in Lake Thun
                 whitefish are caused by genetic factors, environmental
                 factors (water, diet) or ``gene $ \times $
                 environment'' interaction. We performed two independent
                 experiments of a three-year duration in which we reared
                 whitefish from fertilization until adulthood and tested
                 the possible causative factors using a matrix design:
                 (i) genetics---comparing the prevalence of gonad
                 malformations in whitefish of different genetic origin
                 reared under identical environmental conditions (same
                 diet, same water, same experimental facility); (ii)
                 environment---comparing the prevalence of gonad
                 malformations in whitefish of the same genetic origin
                 reared in different water sources and/or fed with
                 different diets; and (iii) gene-environment
                 interaction---comparing the prevalence of gonad
                 morphological alterations in relation to the
                 combinations of genetics and environmental factors. Two
                 diets were used for the rearing experiments: either
                 zooplankton collected in Lake Thun which represents the
                 natural diet of whitefish, or an artificial dry food
                 which was used as control. The key finding of this
                 study is that the inducing factor of the gonad
                 malformations is contained in the zooplankton of Lake
                 Thun. Fish fed with this diet developed a significantly
                 higher prevalence of malformations than fish from any
                 other treatment, irrespective of the genetic origin
                 and/or the water source. This result could be repeated
                 in the two independent experiments. Importantly, the
                 prevalence values observed in the experimental fish fed
                 with Lake Thun zooplankton were similar to the
                 prevalence values recorded in free-ranging whitefish in
                 the lake. The findings of this study advance the
                 understanding of the causes of gonad morphological
                 alterations in wild fish populations.",

                 freshwater. Removing an aquatic invasive species
                 following arrival is almost impossible, and preventing
                 introduction is a more viable management option.
                 Bigheaded carp are an invasive fish spreading
                 throughout the Midwestern {United States} and are
                 threatening to enter the Great Lakes. This review
                 outlines the development of carbon dioxide gas (CO 2)
                 as a non-physical barrier that can be used to deter the
                 movement of fish and prevent further spread. Carbon
                 dioxide gas could be used as a deterrent either to
                 cause avoidance (i.e., fish swim away from zones of
                 high CO 2), or by inducing equilibrium loss due to the
                 anesthetic properties of CO 2 (i.e., tolerance). The
                 development of CO 2 as a fish deterrent started with
                 controlled laboratory experiments demonstrating stress
                 and avoidance, and then progressed to larger field
                 applications demonstrating avoidance at scales that
                 approach real-world scenarios. In addition, factors
                 that influence the effectiveness of CO 2 as a fish
                 barrier are discussed, outlining conditions that could
                 make CO 2 less effective in the field; these factors
                 that influence efficacy would be of interest to
                 managers using CO 2 to target other fish species, or
                 those using other non-physical barriers for fish.",

  abstract =     "Striped bass is the subject of important commercial
                 and sport fisheries in North America. The Roanoke River
                 drainage---especially Smith Mountain Lake, Leesville
                 Lake, and Kerr Reservoir---has popular recreational
                 striped bass fisheries. After construction of five
                 hydroelectric dams, populations became landlocked,
                 declined, and have been supplemented by stocking. A key
                 basis for responsibly augmenting populations is to
                 characterize genetic variation and incorporate the
                 findings into responsible hatchery and stocking
                 practices. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite DNA
                 loci was evaluated among 837 striped bass representing
                 16 collections across the native range; populations
                 from rivers in South Carolina, North Carolina,
                 Chesapeake Bay, and Hudson River were screened to
                 provide context for assessing genetic structure within
                 the Roanoke system. Analysis of population genetic
                 differentiation showed landlocked Roanoke River striped
                 bass to be distinctive. Subject to genetic isolation,
                 high M ratios, and relatively low N e estimates suggest
                 loss of genetic variation, and relatedness analysis
                 showed heightened frequencies of related individuals.
                 These insights into population genetics, demographics,
                 and existing guidelines for broodstock acquisition and
                 mating designs can inform genetically cognizant
                 hatchery management and stocking for striped bass in
                 the Roanoke River drainage. In particular, we recommend
                 the use of larger numbers of breeders and factorial
                 mating designs to increase the genetic diversity of
                 propagated striped bass stocked within the Roanoke
                 River drainage.",

                 toxicity assessment. However, current guidelines for
                 toxicity assessment focus on teratogenicity and
                 mortality. From an ecotoxicological point of view,
                 however, these endpoints may not reflect the ``full
                 picture'' of possible deleterious effects that can
                 nonetheless result in decreased fitness and/or
                 inability to adapt to a changing environment, affecting
                 whole populations. Therefore, assessing sublethal
                 effects add relevant data covering different aspects of
                 toxicity at different levels of analysis. The impacts
                 of toxicants on neurobehavioral function have the
                 potential to affect many different life-history traits,
                 and are easier to assess in the laboratory than in the

                 experiments on different behavioral domains---including
                 anxiety, aggression, and exploration---can increase our
                 understanding of the ecotoxicological impacts of
                 contaminants, since these domains are related to traits
                 such as defense, sociality, and reproduction, directly
                 impacting life-history traits. The effects of selected
                 contaminants on these tests are reviewed, focusing on
                 larval and adult zebrafish, showing that these
                 behavioral domains are highly sensitive to small
                 concentrations of these substances. These strategies

                 class of materials that encompasses bacterial, fungal
                 (yeast), microalgal-derived products or the combination
                 of all three microbial groups into microbial bioflocs
                 and aggregates. In this review we focus on those dried
                 and processed single-cell organisms used as potential
                 ingredients for aqua-feeds where the microorganisms are
                 considered non-viable and are used primarily to provide
                 protein, lipids or specific nutritional components.
                 Among the SCI, there is a generalised dichotomy in
                 terms of their use as either single-cell protein (SCP)
                 resources or single-cell oil (SCO) resources, with SCO
                 products being those oleaginous products containing 200
                 g/kg or more of lipids, whereas those products
                 considered as SCP resources tend to contain more than
                 300 g/kg of protein (on a dry basis). Both SCP and SCO
                 are now widely being used as protein/amino acid
                 sources, omega-3 sources and sources of bioactive
                 molecules in the diets of several species, with the
                 current range of both these ingredient groups being
                 considerable and growing. However, the different array
                 of products becoming available in the market, how they
                 are produced and processed has also resulted in
                 different nutritional qualities in those products. In
                 assessing this variation among the products and the
                 application of the various types of SCI, we have taken
                 the approach of evaluating their use against a set of
                 standardised evaluation criteria based around key
                 nutritional response parameters and how these criteria

                 awareness of feed-quality issues and firmly establish

                 efficiency ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and
                 specific growth rate and lower in mortality rate than
                 the E.P group. All cases of mortality were caused by
                 six kinds of disease, four of which (Vibrio sp.,
                 Edwardsiella sp., Streptococcus sp., and
                 Scuticociliates) were common to the two groups, whereas
                 Lymphocystis arose only in the M.P group and abdominal
                 inflation only in the E.P group at both farms. As for
                 mortality in the present experiment, the numbers were
                 1047 at Da-Hae farm and 1167 at Global farm, with more

  abstract =     "This study aimed to determine the optimal live feed
                 regime (i.e., initial feeding moment, density, and
                 frequency) for maximum growth and survival of pangasius
                 catfish (\bioname{Pangasianodon hypophthalmus}) early
                 life history stages. The first experiment assessed the
                 optimal initial feeding moment (30, 36, 42, and 48 h
                 post hatching, hph). The second experiment assessed
                 feeding density (3, 5, 8 and 11 individuals per mL,
                 ind/mL) at the optimal initial feeding moment (30 hph)
                 which was the best result from the first experiment.
                 The third experiment assessed optimal feeding frequency
                 (1, 2, 4, and 6 times per day) at the optimal initial
                 feeding moment (30 hph) and density (8 ind/mL) which
                 was drawn upon from the second experiment. All
                 experiments were conducted in 20 L containers
                 containing 20 hph P. hypophthalmus larvae at a density
                 of 10 ind/L and fed rotifers (Brachionus angularis) for
                 3 days and then water fleas (\bioname{Moina macrocopa})
                 for 7 days. The first experiment demonstrated that
                 larvae initially fed at 30 hph exhibited a
                 significantly higher survival rate (24\%) than larvae
                 initially fed at 36, 42, and 48 hph (19\%, 16\%, and
                 16\%), respectively. The second experiment demonstrated
                 that larvae fed at 8 and 11 ind/mL densities exhibited
                 significantly higher survival rates (32\% and 32\%)
                 than larvae fed at 3 and 5 ind/mL densities (13\% and
                 23\%), respectively. The third experiment demonstrated
                 that the highest survival rate (66\%) was obtained when
                 larvae were fed 6 times per day. These results provide
                 valuable insights regarding the optimal live feed
                 regime for better growth and survival of P.

                 Individuals with different numbers of vertebrae have
                 been reported. This number ranges from 24 to 26
                 vertebrae. In this study a sample of 73 individual
                 seabass were collected from fish farms and divided into

                 the third group, adult individuals. The number and the
                 length of their vertebrae were measured by radiographs.
                 The individuals were divided into subgroups according
                 to their vertebrae number, and from each one the tenth
                 vertebra was taken. Ca and P levels (\%) of each tenth

  abstract =     "The common carp has been highly problematic in North
                 American ecosystems since its introduction over a
                 century ago. In many watersheds, its abundance appears
                 to be driven by source-sink dynamics in which carp
                 reproduce successfully in peripheral ponds that lack
                 egg/larva micro-predators which then serve as sources
                 of recruits for deeper lakes. This manuscript describes
                 how carp were sustainably reduced in two chains of
                 lakes by disrupting source-sink dynamics in three
                 steps. First, we ascertained whether lakes had
                 problematic densities of carp that could be explained
                 by source-sink dynamics. Second, ways to control
                 recruitment were developed and implemented including:
                 (i) aerating source ponds to reduce hypoxia and
                 increase micro-predator abundance, (ii) blocking carp
                 migration, and (iii) locating and removing adults from
                 sinks using targeted netting guided by Judas fish.
                 Third, we monitored and adapted. Using this strategy,
                 the density of carp in 3 lakes in one chain was reduced
                 from 177 kg/ha to $ \approx $100 kg/ha in 3 years and
                 held constant for a decade. Similarly, adult density
                 was reduced from 300 kg carp/ha in 2 lakes in the other
                 chain to 25 kg/ha. Once carp densities were low,
                 aluminum sulfate treatments became reasonable and once
                 conducted, water quality improved.",

                 high regeneration capacity that interacts with the
                 surrounding environment and provides protection.
                 Functional importance, high complexity and activity
                 make skin an attractive tissue for studying the effects
                 of environmental challenges and chemical stressors in
                 fish. The aim of this work was to characterize skin
                 from polar cod (\bioname{Boreogadus saida}) and
                 Atlantic cod (\bioname{Gadus morhua}), and to test cod
                 skin as an in vitro model in exposure studies. Both
                 species have similar skin structures including
                 epidermis, mucous cells, club cells and scales.
                 However, microarchitectural differences were detected;
                 Atlantic cod has a smooth epidermal surface and
                 overlapping scales, whereas polar cod has a folded
                 outer surface and discontinuous scales. Genome-wide
                 microarray found 6.5k genes with expression
                 differences, which suggested more active turnover of
                 proteins, proliferation and motility of cells in skin
                 of polar cod. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used to
                 examine skin responses. Transcriptome response was
                 stronger in the skin of polar cod, with 155
                 differentially expressed genes. The skin from Atlantic
                 cod was further used to develop a cell culture. H 2 O 2
                 decreased the cell migration rate in a dose-dependent
                 manner, which could indicate reduced skin healing
                 capacity. The results revealed novel skin structures
                 and confirmed that the skin from cod is a promising
                 tissue for evaluation of stressors.",

  abstract =     "Ruffe (\bioname{Gymnocephalus cernua}) were introduced
                 to North America from Europe in the mid-1980s and based
                 on similar diets and habit use may compete with yellow
                 perch (\bioname{Perca flavescens}). To examine
                 competitive interactions between invasive ruffe and
                 native yellow perch, individually marked perch and
                 ruffe were placed in mesocosms in a small lake.
                 Mesocosms allowed fish to interact and feed on the
                 natural prey populations enclosed. In the first
                 experiment, four treatments were assessed: 28 perch, 14
                 perch + 14 ruffe, 14 perch, and 7 perch + 7 ruffe.
                 Yellow perch growth was significantly lower in the
                 presence of ruffe (ANOVA, p = 0.005) than in treatments
                 containing only perch. In a second experiment, an
                 increasing density of one species was superimposed upon
                 a constant density of the other in parallel treatment
                 series. Growth rates of both ruffe and perch declined
                 when ruffe density was increased (t test, p = 0.006).
                 However, neither ruffe nor perch growth was affected by
                 increasing perch density. Total stomach content mass of
                 perch was significantly decreased by ruffe in both
                 years (p {$<$} 0.02), but no effects of ruffe on the
                 composition of perch diets were observed. Ruffe growth
                 and food consumption was greater than that of perch for

  abstract =     "Stingrays play a key role in the regulation of
                 nearshore ecosystems. However, their movement ecology
                 in high-energy surf areas remains largely unknown due
                 to the notorious difficulties in conducting research in
                 these environments. Using a blimp as an aerial platform
                 for video surveillance, we overcame some of the
                 limitations of other tracking methods, such as the use
                 of tags and drones. This novel technology offered
                 near-continuous coverage to characterise the fine-scale
                 movements of stingrays in a surf area in Kiama,
                 Australia, without any invasive procedures. A total of
                 98 stingray tracks were recorded, providing 6 h 27 min
                 of movement paths. The tracking data suggest that
                 stingrays may use a depth gradient located in the
                 sandflat area of the bay for orientating their
                 movements and transiting between locations within their
                 home range. Our research also indicates that stingray
                 behaviour was influenced by diel periods and tidal
                 states. We observed a higher stingray occurrence during
                 the afternoon, potentially related to foraging and
                 anti-predatory strategies. We also saw a reduced route
                 fidelity during low tide, when the bathymetric
                 reference was less accessible due to stranding risk.
                 Considering the increasing threat of anthropogenic
                 development to nearshore coastal environments, the
                 identification of these patterns can better inform the
                 management and mitigation of threats.",

                 study, we analyzed the effect of positive and negative

                 compared the muscle quality of grass carp
                 (\bioname{Ctenopharyngodon idellus}) cultured at
                 salinities of 0\permille, 3\permille, and 6\permille
                 (GC0, GC3, GC6). There was no significant difference in
                 crude protein and crude fat content of muscle between
                 GC0 and GC3. Crude fat was significantly lower in GC6
                 compared to the other groups. GC3 and GC6 had higher
                 hydroxyproline content, which suggested that these
                 groups had higher collagen content. GC3 and GC6 had
                 higher contents of free amino acids and umami amino
                 acids than GC0, but there was no significant difference
                 in sweet or sour amino-acid content among groups. GC3

                 water-holding capacity among the groups. As the
                 salinity increased, the diameter of muscle fibers
                 decreased and the sarcolemma showed a thickening trend.
                 These results suggest that a slight increase in

  abstract =     "Common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus carpio}, L. 1758) are
                 the most abundant pest fish species in Australia,
                 detrimental to ecosystem integrity and values, and in
                 need of suitable management solutions. In January 1995,
                 this destructive pest was discovered in two large,
                 connected Tasmanian lakes --- Lakes Crescent (23 km 2)
                 and Sorell (54 km 2). After an initial assessment, carp
                 were immediately contained to these waters using
                 screens to prevent their escape down-stream, followed
                 by swift legislation to enforce closure of the lakes to
                 the public. Assessment and evaluation of carp numbers
                 occurred throughout the eradication program, with
                 effort focused on Lake Crescent. Beginning with
                 undirected removal, techniques progressively evolved to
                 more sophisticated targeted removal with assistance
                 from biotelemetry, in conjunction with gill netting and
                 electro-fishing. Real-time population estimates and in
                 situ observations resulted in a detailed cumulative
                 understanding of carp population dynamics, behaviour
                 and seasonal habitat choice. This allowed strategic
                 deployment of fences to block access to marshes, and
                 the installation of steel traps within the fences.
                 These gears specifically prevented spawning
                 opportunities, while concurrently capturing mature
                 fish. Following 12 years of adaptive and integrated
                 effort, 7797 carp (fry, juvenile and adult) were
                 captured from Lake Crescent, with the last carp being
                 caught in December 2007. The subsequent 14 years of
                 monitoring has not resulted in the capture of any carp,
                 confirming the successful eradication of carp from Lake
                 Crescent. These management practices have been
                 successfully replicated in the larger Lake Sorell,
                 where 41,499 carp (fry, juvenile and adult) have been
                 removed. It is now estimated that there are few, if any
                 carp remaining. Collectively, the techniques and
                 strategies described here were reliable, and can be
                 applied as a model to control or eradicate pest
                 populations of carp in freshwater lakes elsewhere.",

                 has been a necessary component of its fishery
                 restoration and recovery goals for 30 years. While
                 adopting the approach of the larger and established sea
                 lamprey control program of the Laurentian Great Lakes,
                 local differences emerged that shifted management focus
                 and effort as the program evolved. Increased investment
                 in lamprey assessment and monitoring revealed
                 under-estimations of population density and
                 distribution in the basin, where insufficient control
                 efforts went unnoticed. As control efforts improved in
                 response to a better understanding of the population,
                 the effects of lamprey on the fishery lessened. A
                 long-term evaluation of fishery responses when lamprey
                 control was started, interrupted, delayed, and enhanced
                 provided evidence of a recurring relationship between
                 the level of control effort applied and the measured
                 suppression of the parasitic sea lamprey population.
                 Changes in levels of control efforts over time showed
                 repeatedly that measurable suppression of the parasitic
                 population required effective control of 80\% of the
                 known larval population. Understanding the importance
                 of assessment and monitoring and the relationship
                 between control effort and population suppression has
                 led to recognition that a comprehensive, not
                 incremental, approach is needed to achieve effective
                 control of sea lamprey in Lake Champlain.",

                 growth rates and asymptotic size) that are used in the
                 management of fisheries stocks. Traditionally in
                 fisheries science, it was common to fit one growth
                 model---the von Bertalanffy growth model---to
                 size-at-age data. However, in recent years, fisheries
                 science has seen an increase in the number of growth
                 models available and the evaluation of multiple growth
                 models for a given species or study. We reviewed n =
                 196 peer-reviewed age and growth studies and n = 50
                 NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
                 regional stock assessments to examine trends in the use
                 of growth models and model selection in fisheries over
                 time. Our results indicate that the total number of age
                 and growth studies increased annually since 1988 with a
                 slight proportional increase in the use of multi-model
                 frameworks. Information theoretic approaches are
                 replacing goodness-of-fit and a priori model selection
                 in fisheries studies; however, this trend is not
                 reflected in NOAA stock assessments, which almost
                 exclusively rely on the von Bertalanffy growth model.
                 Covariates such as system (e.g., marine or fresh),
                 location of study, diet, family, maximum age, and range
                 of age data used in model fitting did not contribute to
                 which model was ultimately the best fitting, suggesting
                 that there are no large-scale patterns of specific
                 growth models being applied to species with common life
                 histories or other attributes. Given the importance and
                 ubiquity of growth modeling to fisheries science, a
                 historical and contemporary understanding of the
                 practice is critical to evaluate improvements that have

                 sea lamprey \bioname{Petromyzon marinus} and allis shad
                 \bioname{Alosa alosa} from the Minho River. This basin

                 critically endangered anadromous fish species. Besides
                 assessing the importance of the environmental drivers
                 of fish capture data (temperature, salinity, upwelling,

                 captured fish from the first progressively improving
                 from 1914 to 2017, and the latter recording a

                 correlations were detected between fishing data and
                 environmental variables, some of the identified
                 breakpoints in the time series data matched the dates

                 historical activities associated with mining might
                 explain the notable changes detected in the trends,

                 environment suitable for survival. However, little is
                 known about the mechanisms regarding detection and
                 selection of salinity environments in fish. This study
                 involved the establishment of a simple aquarium system
                 in which fish can swim between freshwater (FW) and
                 seawater (SW) in a single tank. In this tank, the lower
                 level contained SW, the upper level contained FW, and
                 the FW and SW levels were clearly separated as
                 different salinity areas. Behavioral experiments of
                 salinity environment selection using this simplified
                 system to evaluate salinity preference showed that
                 FW-acclimated medakas preferred FW to SW. In contrast,
                 SW-acclimated medakas preferred SW to FW. These results
                 indicate that euryhaline medakas prefer the saline
                 habitats to which they are acclimated, when able to
                 select the salinity environment. We identified the
                 taste receptor type-2 and polycystic kidney disease
                 2-like 1 genes as possibly related to high-salinity
                 taste in medaka. The expression of these genes
                 increased at certain time points after SW challenges.
                 In this study, we established an aquarium system to
                 facilitate a simple experiment for salinity preference.
                 Our results suggest that the medaka is good model for
                 research related to seawater environment selection in

                 hsp47-like cDNAs were cloned and characterized in grass
                 carp (\bioname{Ctenopharyngodon idella}). The cDNAs
                 were 1212 and 1218 base pairs long, respectively, and
                 included an open reading frame encoding 403 and 405
                 amino acids. The molecular phylogeny based on the
                 deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the correct
                 sequences of the hsp47 and hsp47-like cDNA were
                 obtained and the deduced proteins clustered distinctly
                 into teleost clades. Primary structure analysis and
                 characterization of Hsp47 and Hsp47-like shared the
                 basic structure and biofunctions of Hsp47 in
                 vertebrates. The spatial pattern of gene expression
                 revealed that hsp47 and hsp47-like were relatively
                 ubiquitous in different tissues and highly expressed in
                 heart and skin. The expression levels of hsp47 and
                 hsp47-like and type I collagen mRNAs varied similarly
                 in different tissues. Type I collagen content increased
                 significantly with the increase of water velocity in
                 the muscle of grass carp in response to aerobic
                 exercise. Among the gene expression changes of hsp47,
                 hsp47-like, col1a1 and col1a2 in muscle that occurred
                 in response to aerobic exercise, the change of type I
                 collagen was most strongly correlated with hsp47
                 expression. Additionally, col1a1 showed the highest
                 correlation with hsp47-like and col1a2 showed the
                 highest correlation with hsp47. These findings suggest
                 that grass carp Hsp47 and Hsp47-like are closely

                 Palabuhanratu Bay is dominated by \bioname{Panulirus
                 homarus} (green sand lobster), \bioname{Panulirus

                 spatial model using satellite-derived data to predict
                 potential lobster harvest grounds in Palabuhanratu Bay.
                 The Earth observational satellite data used were

                 salinity: 20.2--23.7 ppt; TSS: 40--56.4 mg/L; SST:
                 29.5--29.9 \degree C; and distance from the coastline:
                 500--4700 m. In this study, the habitats of four

                 convulsion (subsequently referred to as delayed
                 convulsion), which undermines the meat quality and
                 taste. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism
                 underlying the delayed convulsion and examine its
                 influence on ATP consumption. Ten carps, nine tilapias,
                 ten rainbow trouts, two ayus, three greenling,
                 thirty-five red seabreams, two striped jack and two
                 stone flounders underwent CS around the medulla
                 oblongata area, which induced different delayed
                 convulsion profiles specific to each species. To
                 investigate the norepinephrine (NE) actions related to
                 delayed convulsion, 27 red seabreams, a representative
                 fish species that exhibits delayed convulsion, were
                 treated with a monoamine-depleting agent, reserpine, or
                 with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline, two
                 hours before CS. Spinal cord destruction (SCD) was
                 employed to completely prevent spinal cord functions of
                 the fish in another group. Compared with the control
                 group (CS only), the reserpine, pargyline, and SCD
                 groups showed significantly inhibited delayed
                 convulsion and ATP consumption. This suggests that
                 delayed convulsion is the main ATP-consuming response.
                 Our findings suggest that delayed clonic convulsion in
                 red seabreams is associated with the rapid decrease in
                 spinal cord NE levels, which triggered the rebound
                 motor neuron hyperactivity.",

                 Mississippi River by passing through its locks-and-dams
                 (LDs). Although these structures already impede fish
                 passage, this role could be greatly enhanced by
                 modifying how their spillway gates operate, adding
                 deterrent systems to their locks, and removing carp.
                 This study examined this possibility using numeric
                 modeling and empirical data, which evaluated all three
                 options on an annual basis in both single LDs and pairs
                 under different river flow conditions. Over 100
                 scenarios were modeled. While all three approaches
                 showed promise, ranging from 8\% to 73\% reductions in
                 how many carp pass a single LD, when employed together
                 at pairs of LDs, upstream movement rates of invasive
                 carp could be reduced 98--99\% from current levels.
                 Although modifying spillway gate operation is the least
                 expensive option, its efficacy drops at high flows, so
                 lock deterrents and/or removal using fishing/trapping
                 are required to move towards complete blockage.
                 Improved deterrent efficacy could also offset the need
                 for more efficient removal. This model could help
                 prioritize research and management actions for
                 containing carp.",

                 terms of initial attention, changes, and development
                 and gradually matured. (2) A gap exists between the
                 content of the fishing insurance policy text and the
                 actual demand. The scoring results of the policy
                 samples are concentrated in the acceptable range, the
                 policy effects are not satisfactory, and the
                 formulation of fishery insurance policies has weak
                 links that need to be improved. (3) The consistency and
                 effectiveness of fishery insurance policies have
                 developed simultaneously with fishery insurance
                 research, and the practical effects of high-quality
                 fishery insurance policies are conducive to the
                 development of theoretical research. (4) The policy
                 text of fishery insurance has major problems, such as
                 missing joint force of issuing institutions, low
                 professionalism of the text, inadequate subdivision
                 guidance of fishery insurance, weak social
                 effectiveness, high dependence on financial subsidies,
                 lack of incentive sustainability and corresponding laws
                 and regulations and reduction in policy feasibility
                 among others. Considering the above issues, this paper
                 puts forward relevant policy optimization paths and

                 widespread. Many stakeholders believe that fishery
                 subsidies play an important role in ensuring the
                 livelihood of fishermen. At the same time, fishery
                 subsidies pose a threat to the stock of fishery
                 resources and affect the sustainable development of
                 fisheries. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces,
                 municipalities, and autonomous regions in China from
                 2007 to 2017, the article empirically examines the
                 influence of fishery subsidies on fishing. The results
                 of the study show that China\prime s fishery subsidies
                 are negatively correlated with fishing. On average, for
                 each 1\% increase in fishery subsidies, fishing will
                 decrease by 2.9\%. That is to say, in general, fishery
                 subsidies are conducive to the sustainable development
                 of fisheries. The results of heterogeneity analysis
                 based on geographic location and economic development
                 level show that fishery subsidies do not have a
                 palpable negative influence on fishing in coastal areas
                 or developed regions, whereas have an obvious adverse
                 influence on fishing in inland areas or underdeveloped

                 search for alternative protein sources is a continuous
                 process. The present feeding trial was conducted to
                 evaluate the effects of replacing fishmeal with
                 zooplankton biomass meal (ZBM) on the growth
                 performance, nutrient utilization, intestine, and liver

                 cephalus} (initial weight of 0.10 \pm 0.01 g). Five
                 isoproteic (35\% crude protein) and isolipidic (8\%
                 crude lipid) diets were formulated as the control diet
                 (Z 0) and the other four diets (Z 25, Z 50, Z 75, and Z
                 100), where 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\% of fishmeal was
                 replaced by ZBM, respectively. After 60 days of
                 feeding, the final weight, weight gain, and daily
                 growth index of the grey mullet fed the Z 100 diet were
                 higher than those fed the control diet (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 In addition, the better values of feed conversion
                 ratio, protein efficiency ratio and lipid efficiency
                 ratio were recorded in the fish fed with the Z 100
                 diet. Additionally, the intestinal villus length,
                 crypts depth, and muscle thickness were significantly
                 improved with ZBM inclusion (p {$<$} 0.05). Meanwhile,
                 there were no histopathological changes observed on the
                 liver when compared with the control group. From the
                 economic point of view, dietary substitution of
                 fishmeal by ZBM (Z 100) reduced the cost of diet
                 formulation by 18\% and the price per kg weight gain by
                 about 40\%. Overall, according to the findings of this

  abstract =     "French Polynesia is experiencing increasing coral
                 bleaching events in shallow waters triggered by thermal
                 anomalies and marine heatwaves linked to climate
                 change, a trend that is replicated worldwide. As sea
                 surface thermal anomalies are assumed to lessen with
                 depth, mesophotic deep reefs have been hypothesized to
                 act as refuges from anthropogenic and natural
                 disturbances, the \lq deep reef refugia hypothesis'
                 (DRRH). However, evidence supporting the DRRH is either
                 inconclusive or conflicting. We address this by
                 investigating four assumptions of the DRRH focusing on
                 the symbiotic association between anemones and
                 anemonefish. First, we compare long-term temperature
                 conditions between shallow (8 m) and mesophotic sites
                 (50 m) on the island of Moorea from 2011--2020. Second,
                 we compare the densities of the orange-fin anemonefish,
                 \bioname{Amphiprion chrysopterus} between shallow and
                 mesophotic (down to 60 m) reefs across three
                 archipelagos in French Polynesia. Finally, we compare
                 the percentage of anemone bleaching, as well as
                 anemonefish reproduction, between shallow and
                 mesophotic reefs. We found that the water column was
                 well mixed in the cooler austral winter months with
                 only a 0.19 \degree C difference in temperature between
                 depths, but in the warmer summer months mixing was
                 reduced resulting in a 0.71--1.03 \degree C temperature
                 difference. However, during thermal anomalies, despite
                 a time lag in warm surface waters reaching mesophotic
                 reefs, there was ultimately a 1.0 \degree C increase in
                 water temperature at both 8 and 50 m, pushing
                 temperatures over bleaching thresholds at both depths.
                 As such, anemone bleaching was observed in mesophotic
                 reefs during these thermal anomalies, but was buffered
                 compared to the percentage of bleaching in shallower
                 waters, which was nearly five times greater. Our
                 large-scale sampling across French Polynesia found
                 orange-fin anemonefish, A. chrysopterus, in mesophotic
                 zones in two high islands and one atoll across two
                 archipelagos, extending its bathymetric limit to 60 m;
                 however, orange-fin anemonefish densities were either
                 similar to, or 25--92 times lower than in shallower
                 zones. Three spawning events were observed at 50 m,
                 which occurred at a similar frequency to spawning on
                 shallower reefs at the same date. Our findings of
                 thermal anomalies and bleaching in mesophotic reefs,
                 coupled with mainly lower densities of anemonefish in
                 mesophotic populations, suggest that mesophotic reefs
                 show only a limited ability to provide refugia from
                 anthropogenic and natural disturbances.",

                 research; however, there are few reports on SNPs
                 related to the growth of \bioname{Penaeus vannamei}.
                 The purpose of this study was to call SNPs from
                 rapid-growing (RG) and slow-growing (SG) individuals'
                 transcriptomes and use DNA pool sequencing to assess
                 the reliability of SNPs. Two parameters were applied to
                 detect SNPs. One parameter was the p -values generated
                 using Fisher's exact test, which were used to calculate
                 the significance of allele frequency differences
                 between RG and SG. The other one was the AFI (minor
                 allele frequency imbalance), which was defined to
                 highlight the fold changes in MAF (minor allele
                 frequency) values between RG and SG. There were 216,015
                 hypothetical SNPs, which were obtained based on the
                 transcriptome data. Finally, 104 high-quality SNPs and
                 96,819 low-quality SNPs were predicted. Then, 18
                 high-quality SNPs and 17 low-quality SNPs were selected
                 to assess the reliability of the detection process.
                 Here, 72.22\% (13/18) accuracy was achieved for
                 high-quality SNPs, while only 52.94\% (9/17) accuracy
                 was achieved for low-quality SNPs. These SNPs enrich
                 the data for population genetics studies of P. vannamei
                 and may play a role in the development of SNP markers

                 importance of selecting the right data error structure

                 values that can lead to biased conclusions. Based on

                 Cynoglossus semilaevis, a species of fish mainly
                 distributed along the west coast of Korea. As its skin
                 is very tough and difficult to process, it is not
                 useful as food. For this reason, most of it is
                 discarded except for a small amount that is used as
                 feed, which results in environmental pollution.
                 Considering this, there is a need for research on the
                 development of functional materials using Cynoglossus

                 activity by up to 21.89\% and 12.04\%, respectively, in
                 a concentration-dependent manner, and increased PIP
                 synthesis by up to 62.24\% in a concentration-dependent
                 manner. The RT-PCR test results using mRNA showed the
                 MMP-1, 2, and 3 expression levels were suppressed in
                 the CSE-treated group compared to the UVB-induced group
                 and caused a concentration-dependent increase in TIMP-1
                 in the CSE-treat group. These results suggest that CSE
                 can maintain and improve skin tissue conditions through
                 MMP/TIMP balancing in human dermal fibroblast cell
                 lines and indicate its potential as a functional
                 material for improving skin diseases and suppressing
                 photo-aging.",

                 stocks of the Hilsa (\bioname{Tenualosa ilisha})

                 scoring approaches (the conservative scoring approach,

                 determine the most reliable approach to minimize false

                 vulnerability. Therefore, ASA is more reliable than CSA

  abstract =     "Brazilian fish farming goes together with the
                 emergence of numerous bacterial diseases, with
                 \bioname{Aeromonas hydrophila} being the main bacterial
                 pathogen. As a consequence, antimicrobials are
                 excessively used. Considering that antimicrobials are
                 relatively stable and nonbiodegradable, medicinal
                 plants and their phytochemicals have been used as
                 alternative treatments of bacteriosis in fish farming.
                 Limonene is a monoterpene available in two enantiomers:
                 R-(+)-limonene and S-(-)-limonene. This study analyzed
                 the antibacterial activity of the phytochemicals
                 S-(-)-limonene and R-(+)-limonene against some bacteria
                 isolated from silver catfish (\bioname{Rhamdia
                 quelen}). Furthermore, by means of spectrophotometry
                 and atomic force microscopy, we also investigated the
                 combination therapy of phytochemicals with
                 antimicrobials and their activity in terms of
                 inhibiting biofilm formation. Six clinical isolates and
                 a standard strain were selected for antimicrobial
                 activity testing. Biofilm formation was tested in
                 96-well plates and nylon cubes. The most sensitive of
                 the strains tested was the A. hydrophila strain (MF
                 372510). S-(-)-limonene and R-(+)-limonene had high
                 minimum inhibitory concentrations; however, they
                 strongly inhibited A. hydrophila biofilm formation.
                 R-(+)-limonene and S-(-)-limonene had an additive
                 effect when combined with florfenicol and an
                 antagonistic effect with oxytetracycline. In general,
                 the phytochemicals tested showed strong antibiofilm
                 activity against A. hydrophila, and when in combination

                 evaluate growth and survival. Juvenile dusky grouper
                 were randomly distributed in twelve 100 L tanks
                 containing four fish per aquarium. The fish were
                 exposed to continuous light, normal photoperiod or
                 continuous darkness for 50 days. Fish were fed 3\% of
                 their total biomass, twice a day, and the diet
                 consisted of ground commercial dry pellets (42\% crude

                 matter, 4\% crude fiber, 3.5\% calcium and 3\% vitamin
                 C, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions).
                 There was no mortality during the experiment. After 50
                 days, the best performance was found for exposure to
                 continuous light (24 h artificial light). The final
                 weight of the fish reared under continuous light was
                 significantly higher than that of the fish exposed to
                 continuous darkness. The specific growth rate of the
                 fish exposed to continuous light was significantly
                 higher than that of the fish exposed to the natural
                 photoperiod and to continuous darkness. Modifications

                 diets were formulated with increasing HIM/FM
                 replacement rate (the control diet contained 20\% FM).
                 Mortality rates, growth performances, and feed
                 consumptions were measured, and fish intestine samples
                 were collected for histological and enzymatic analysis.
                 After 49 days, all groups almost tripled their initial
                 body weight (cumulative body weight gain ranged between
                 143.9 and 155.2 mg), and no statistically significant
                 differences among treatments were observed in relation
                 to growth performances and histological traits.
                 Contrarily, trypsin, alkaline phosphatases, and alpha
                 amylase--glucoamylase activities were significantly
                 reduced when the FM replacement rate was increased. In
                 conclusion, HIM may represent an alternative to FM,
                 since no adverse effects were observed when it was
                 included up to 20\% in the zebrafish diet, even when
                 replacing 100\% of the FM.",

  abstract =     "Community-based monitoring programs (CBMPs) are a
                 cost-effective option to collect the long-term data
                 required to effectively monitor estuaries. Data quality
                 concerns have caused some CBMP datasets, which could
                 fill knowledge gaps for aquatic ecosystems, to go
                 unused. The Community Aquatic Monitoring Program (CAMP)
                 is a CBMP that has collected littoral nekton assemblage
                 data from estuaries in the southern Gulf of St.
                 Lawrence since 2003. Concerns with the CAMP sampling
                 design (station placement and numbers) have prevented
                 decision-makers from using the data to inform estuary
                 health assessments. This study tested if CAMP's
                 sampling design that accommodates volunteer
                 participation provides similar information as a
                 scientific sampling approach. Six CAMP stations and six
                 stations selected using a stratified random design were
                 sampled at ten estuaries. A permutational-MANOVA
                 revealed nekton assemblages were generally not
                 significantly different between the two sampling
                 designs. The current six CAMP stations are sufficient
                 to detect the larger differences in species abundances
                 that may indicate differences in estuary condition. The
                 predicted increase in precision (2\%) with twelve
                 stations is not substantive enough to warrant an
                 increased sampling effort. CAMP's scientific utility is
                 not limited by station selection bias or numbers.
                 Furthermore, well-designed CBMPs can produce comparable
                 data to scientific studies.",

                 can be useful in aquaculture due to possible sedative
                 and/or anesthetic effects. Four M. tinctoria extracts
                 were extracted separately with ethanol; leaves (LE),
                 bark (BE), heartwood (HE), and the sapwood (SE). In

                 Here, we collected 21 time series of demersal fishes
                 from 1956 to 2015 to investigate the climate-induced

                 demersal fishes experienced state shifts in
                 approximately 1986/87, accompanied by abrupt warming
                 over this region. Moreover, the relationships between
                 demersal fishes and sea surface temperature (SST) were

                 five groups of 150 fingerlings/group with three
                 replicates (n = 50) per group. Group 1 was fed a basal

                 SBp (autoclaved and acid-treated, respectively) as
                 soybean replacer for 12 weeks, while, in G4 and G5, SBp

                 important role in the growth and development of

                 association between the Smad3 gene and the growth
                 traits of mollusks. In this study, Smad3 from the hard
                 clam \bioname{Meretrix meretrix} (Mm-Smad3) was cloned,
                 characterized, and screened for growth-related single
                 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its exons. The
                 full-length cDNA of Mm-Smad3 was 1938 bp, encoding a
                 protein with 428 amino acid residues. The protein
                 sequence included an MH1 (27--135 aa) and MH2 domain
                 (233--404 aa). Promoter analysis showed that the
                 promoter sequence of Mm-Smad3 was 2548 bp, and the
                 binding sites of Pit-1a, Antp, Hb, and other
                 transcription factors are related to the growth and
                 development of hard clams. The phylogenetic tree was
                 divided into two major clusters, including mollusks and
                 vertebrate. The expression level of Mm-Smad3 was
                 predominantly detected in the mantle and foot, while
                 extremely less expression was observed in the digestive
                 gland. The low expression level of Mm-Smad3 was
                 detected at the stages of unfertilized mature eggs,
                 fertilized eggs, four-cell embryos, blastula,
                 gastrulae, trochophore, and D-shaped larvae, whereas an
                 opposite trend was observed regarding the highest
                 expression at the umbo larvae stage (p {$<$} 0.05). In
                 the mantle repair experiment, the time-course
                 expression profiles showed that compared to the
                 expression level at 0 h, Mm-Smad3 significantly
                 decreased at 6 h (p {$<$} 0.05) but increased at 12 and
                 48 h. Further, the association analysis identified 11

                 (c.597 C $>$ T, c.660 C $>$ T, c.792 A $>$ T) were
                 significantly related to the growth traits of clam (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). Overall, our findings indicated that
                 Mm-Smad3 is a growth-related gene and the detected SNP

                 and 17RbGs were 112,360 and 112,235 bp long,
                 respectively (115 and 114 open reading frames [ORFs],

                 mutations (ORFs 014R and 102R on the basis of 17SbTy)
                 in regions encoding functional proteins (a DNA-binding
                 protein and a myristoylated membrane protein). Notably,
                 survival rates differed significantly between
                 17SbTy-infected and 17RbGs-infected rock breams,

                 correct management of water resources. Flat-V gauging
                 weirs are facilities used worldwide for measuring
                 discharge. These structures consist of a small weir
                 with a triangular cross-section and a flat ``V''-shaped
                 notch. Their extensive use is a consequence of their
                 utility in the measurement of both low and high flow
                 conditions. However, depending on their size, local
                 morphology and river discharge can act as full or
                 partial hydraulic barriers to fish migration. To
                 address this concern, the present work studies fish
                 passage performance over flat-V weirs considering their
                 hydraulic performance. For this, radio-tracking and
                 video-monitoring observations were combined with
                 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in two flat-V
                 weirs, using Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) as
                 the target species. Results showed that fish passage is
                 conditioned by both hydraulic and behavioral processes,
                 providing evidence for scenarios in which flat-V weirs
                 may act as full or partial barriers to upstream
                 movements. For the studied flat-V weirs, a discharge
                 range of 0.27--8 m 3 /s, with a water drop difference
                 between upstream and downstream water levels lower than
                 0.7 m and a depth downstream of the weir of higher than
                 0.3 m can be considered an effective passage situation
                 for barbels. These findings are of interest for
                 quantifying flat-V weir impacts, for engineering
                 applications and for establishing managing or

                 (\bioname{Trichiurus lepturus}, also known as T.
                 japonicus) is a commercially important element of
                 Chinese fisheries. Hairtail has long been widely
                 exploited. Due to overfishing, however, its production
                 declined over the years. One of solutions to this
                 dilemma is to institute reasonable fishery policies.
                 Generally, skillful short-term and long-term prediction
                 of fish catch is a central tool for guiding the
                 development of fishery policy. Accurate predictions
                 require a comprehensive understanding of the
                 relationship between fluctuations in fish catch and
                 variability in both fishing effort and marine
                 environmental conditions. To investigate the combined
                 impact of fishing effort and marine environments on
                 hairtail catch and to develop models to predict
                 hairtail catch, we applied empirical dynamic modeling
                 (EDM) to data on East China Sea fisheries, including
                 hairtail catch, fishing effort, and marine
                 environmental factors. EDM is an equation-free approach
                 that enables the investigation of various complex
                 systems. We constructed all possible multivariate EDM
                 models to investigate the potential mechanisms
                 affecting hairtail catch. Our analysis demonstrates
                 that all key environmental factors (salinity, summer
                 monsoon, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and
                 power dissipation index of tropical cyclones) have an
                 impact on nutrient supply, which we suggest is the
                 central factor influencing hairtail catch. Finally, our
                 comparison of EDM models with parametric models
                 demonstrates that EDM models overwhelmingly outperform
                 parametric models in analysis of these complex

                 a total of 149,814 nonredundant unigenes were obtained
                 with an N50 length of 3538 bp. Of these candidates,
                 122,719 unigenes (81.91\% of the total) were
                 successfully annotated with multiple public databases.
                 The comparison analysis revealed 10,385 unigenes (2034
                 in females and 8351 in males) were differentially
                 expressed between different sexes of T. poecilonotus.
                 Then, we identified many candidate growth- and
                 sex-related genes, including Dmrt1, Sox3, Spatas, Prl /
                 Prlr, fabps, Ghr, and Igf1r. In addition to these
                 well-known genes, Fabp 4 was identified for the first
                 time in fish. Furthermore, 68,281 simple sequence
                 repeats (SSRs) loci were screened and identified in the
                 transcriptome sequence of T. poecilonotus. The results
                 of our study could provide valuable information on
                 growth- and sex-associated genes and facilitate further
                 exploration of the molecular mechanism of sexual growth

                 gene, plays an important role in the absorption of
                 glutamine. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence
                 of ASCT2 was cloned from triploid crucian carp. It
                 encodes 539 amino acid residues and a stop codon.
                 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences of
                 the ASCT2 ORF region in cyprinid fishes shared high
                 sequence homology. Comparing the abundance of ASCT2 in
                 different tissues, we found its expression level in
                 muscle was significantly higher than that in intestine
                 (p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, the expression levels of
                 ASCT2 also appeared different in diurnal variation.
                 Then we found the addition of 2.5\% glutamate in a
                 feeding diet significantly increased the expression
                 levels of ASCT2 in intestine and muscle (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 However, in glutamine experiments, the muscle showed
                 the highest expression level of ASCT2 when fish were
                 fed the diet containing 3.0\% glutamine (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 In vitro, ASCT2 was sensitive to glutamine and its
                 expression level appeared down-regulated when the
                 addition of glutamine was added to 0.1 mg/mL. Finally,
                 we found that the diet with 29\% protein level
                 significantly increased the expression level of ASCT2
                 in intestine (p {$<$} 0.05). Nevertheless, different
                 protein sources (fish meal and soybean meal) had no
                 significant effect on the expression levels of ASCT2 in
                 intestine and muscle (p $>$ 0.05). These results
                 provided data for the study of ASCT2 in triploid

                 administered as single or multiple mixtures. The
                 expected benefits of probiotics include disease
                 prophylaxis, improved growth, and feed conversion
                 parameters, such as the feed conversion rate (FCR) and
                 specific growth rate (SGR). In the current work, we
                 review the impact of probiotics on freshwater finfish
                 aquaculture. Data were gathered from articles published
                 during the last decade that examined the effects of
                 probiotics on fish growth, FCR, and water quality in
                 freshwater fishponds/tanks. While the expected benefits
                 of probiotics are significant, the reviewed data
                 indicate a range in the level of effects, with an
                 average reduction in ammonia of 50.7\%, SGR increase of
                 17.1\%, and FCR decrease of 10.7\%. Despite the
                 variability in the reported benefits, probiotics appear
                 to offer a practical solution for sustainable
                 freshwater aquaculture. Disease prophylaxis with
                 probiotics can reduce the need for antibiotics and
                 maintain gut health and feed conversion. Considering
                 that fish feed and waste are two significant parameters
                 of the aquaculture ecological footprint, it can be
                 argued that probiotics can contribute to reducing the
                 environmental impact of aquaculture. In this direction,
                 it would be beneficial if more researchers incorporated
                 water quality parameters in future aquaculture research
                 and protocols to minimize aquaculture's environmental

                 push native fish species out of their preferred
                 habitat, including their thermal optima. To examine
                 these interactions, we built an experimental thermal
                 preference chamber to evaluate: (1) the thermal
                 preference of native, glacial relict northern redbelly
                 dace \bioname{Chrosomus eos}; (2) if the thermal

                 invasive western mosquitofish \bioname{Gambusia

                 interactions. We hypothesized that G. affinis would
                 express agonistic behavior toward C. eos, because G.
                 affinis is widely recognized as an aggressive invader.
                 Given the temperature range of the experimental
                 chamber, i.e., 20--30 {$^\circ $}C, C. eos selected an
                 average of 24.3 {$^\circ $}C as its thermal preference.
                 After G. affinis ' introduction, the thermal preference
                 of C. eos increased by 1.7 {$^\circ $}C and the
                 movement, given by distance (cm) travelled, increased
                 by 21\%. Contrary to our prediction, more agonistic
                 interactions were observed in C. eos toward G. affinis.
                 These results indicate that agonistic behavior of G.
                 affinis toward native fish species may be species- and
                 condition-specific, and may not always be the primary
                 mechanism of native species' displacement. Biological
                 invasions are a global issue and altered thermal
                 regimes are expected to continue. This study provided
                 the novel approach using of a thermally heterogeneous
                 thermal chamber to examine thermal preferences and
                 aggressive interactions between a native and an

                 life history traits that may be conveying the

                 Valenciennes, 1839) is a conspicuous, iconic and
                 ecologically important coral reef fish species. B.
                 muricatum plays an important role in the bioerosion of
                 the reef framework and as a result has been described
                 as both an ecosystem engineer and keystone species.
                 Despite the complete absence of B. muricatum from 32
                 years of scientific surveys across the Ningaloo Reef
                 World Heritage Area, we recorded a total of 155
                 individuals of B. muricatum across 63.2 ha of reef
                 crest surveys, equating to mean density of 2.38 ind/ha.
                 Our observations represent the first record of this
                 iconic species in scientific surveys at Ningaloo and in
                 combination with qualitative observations of B.
                 muricatum by expert witnesses, indicate B. muricatum is
                 likely to have been present in ecologically relevant
                 densities since 2006. The densities of B. muricatum
                 observed at northern Ningaloo in 2021 suggest this
                 species is removing an estimated 13.42 tonnes/ha or
                 1.34 kg/m 2 of calcium carbonate per year, which is
                 broadly comparable with estimates of total parrotfish
                 bioerosion across many reefs in the central Indian and
                 Pacific Oceans. Although not currently afforded
                 elevated conservation status within management plans,
                 B. muricatum possess many life-history characteristics

  abstract =     "Aquatic organisms, such as fish, are important
                 indicators of the bioavailability of metals in coastal
                 environments, demonstrating the capacity of different
                 species to bioaccumulate these metallic elements. The
                 fluvial-lagoon system of the Palizada River is an
                 important ecosystem for its terrestrial and aquatic
                 biological diversity where fishing is an important
                 productive activity in this system. The objective of
                 this research was to evaluate the concentration of Pb
                 and Cd in the muscle tissue of native and invasive fish
                 species in this area. For this, the digestion of fish
                 muscle samples was carried out with a CEM MARS 5
                 Digestion Microwave System, while the quantification of
                 metals was performed with an atomic absorption
                 equipment. All analysis muscle samples from native and
                 invasive fish showed Pb and Cd in their content. By
                 sampling site there was a statistically significant
                 difference (p {$<$} 0.05), with a maximum Pb
                 concentration of 7.760 $ \mu $ g g {-1} at the LLAR
                 site (Laguna Larga). In terms of species, the maximum
                 Cd concentration was obtained in the \bioname{Cyprinus
                 carpio} with 6.630 {\pm} 0.127 and in Pterygoplichthus

                 weight). The presence of metals such as Pb and Cd in
                 muscle tissue of native and invasive fish species
                 represents an important bioindicator of environmental
                 exposure in the study area and a potential risk to

                 communities have received little attention when used as
                 biological tags for identifying fish stocks. This study
                 evaluated the potential spatial and temporal
                 variability of the parasite communities affecting three
                 marine fish species collected between 1993 and 2017. To
                 avoid the potential effect of host age in parasite
                 communities, individuals of similar ages were selected:
                 1123 \bioname{Engraulis ringens} (12--24 months old),
                 1904 \bioname{Trachurus murphyi} (24--36 months old),
                 and 630 \bioname{Merluccius gayi} (36--48 months old).
                 Most taxa show differences in the prevalence at the
                 spatial and temporal scales, but the prevalence of some
                 larval endoparasites remains constant at the temporal
                 scale. At the spatial scale, an analysis of similarity
                 (ANOSIM) showed differences in the parasite communities
                 of three species; a canonical analysis of principal
                 coordinates (CAP) showed low values of correct
                 allocations (CA; {\SGMLasymp}50\%) and values of
                 allocation due to chance (AdC) were lower than the CA.
                 At the temporal scale, an ANOSIM showed differences
                 between the three species. A CAP showed low values of
                 CA ({\SGMLasymp}50--60\%) and the AdC was always lower
                 than CA. Samples at the spatial scale were well
                 allocated to their localities or nearby localities,
                 suggesting a spatial stability. Samples from different
                 years were not well discriminated, suggesting temporal
                 variability. Therefore, in studies regarding parasites
                 as a tool for stock identification, temporal
                 variability must be taken into account.",

                 we report the molecular evolution of the parvalbumin
                 genes in bony fishes based on 19 whole genomes and 70
                 transcriptomes. We found unexpectedly high parvalbumin
                 diversity in teleosts; three main gene types
                 (pvalb-{\alpha}, pvalb-{\beta}1, and pvalb-{\beta}2,
                 including oncomodulins) originated at the onset of
                 vertebrates. Teleosts have further multiplied the
                 parvalbumin gene repertoire up to nine ancestral
                 copies---two copies of pvalb-{\alpha}, two copies of
                 pvalb-{\beta}1, and five copies of pvalb-{\beta}2. This
                 gene diversity is a result of teleost-specific
                 whole-genome duplication. Two conserved parvalbumin
                 genomic clusters carry pvalb-{\beta}1 and {\beta}2
                 copies, whereas pvalb-{\alpha} genes are located
                 separately in different linkage groups. Further, we
                 investigated parvalbumin gene expression in 17 tissues
                 of the common carp (\bioname{Cyprinus carpio}), a
                 species with 21 parvalbumin genes in its genome. Two
                 pvalb-{\alpha} and eight pvalb-{\beta}2 copies are
                 highly expressed in the muscle, while two alternative
                 pvalb-{\alpha} copies show expression in the brain and
                 the testes, and pvalb-{\beta}1 is dominant in the
                 retina and the kidney. The recent pairs of muscular
                 pvalb-{\beta}2 genes show differential expression in
                 this species. We provide robust genomic evidence of the

                 they alter habitats, compete with native fish for food,
                 and prey on native fishes, exerting both indirect and
                 direct effects on ecosystems and economies. While

                 article serves as an introduction to these articles
                 which focus on 5 topics on invasive freshwater fish:
                 (1) the damage they cause (one article); (2) techniques
                 to ascertain their presence (one article); (3)
                 techniques to restrict their movement (one article);
                 (4) strategies to control them (three articles); and
                 (5) lessons learned from ongoing management efforts
                 (five articles). This introduction notes that
                 successful management efforts share a few approaches:
                 (1) they develop and use a deep understanding of local
                 species and their abundance as well as distribution;
                 (2) they focus on reducing reproductive success; (3)
                 they use multiple complimentary control strategies; and
                 (4) they use a long-term approach.",

                 extrapolated to infinity (AUC INF\_obs) of 25,261.62

                 fishes, but it relies on differences in underlying
                 geology that may occur over large spatial scales. An
                 examination of how small a spatial scale on which this
                 technique can be implemented, especially in water
                 bodies that share a large proportion of their flow,
                 would be useful for guiding aquatic invasive species
                 control efforts. We examined trace isotopic signatures
                 in northern pike (\bioname{Esox lucius}) otoliths to
                 estimate their provenance between two reservoirs in the
                 Upper Yampa River Basin, Colorado, USA. This is a
                 challenging study area as these reservoirs are only
                 11-rkm apart on the same river and thus share a high
                 proportion of their inflow. We found that three
                 isotopes (86 Sr, 137 Ba, and 55 Mn) were useful in
                 discriminating between these reservoirs, but their
                 signatures varied annually, and the values overlapped.
                 Strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) were different
                 between sites and relatively stable across three years,
                 which made them an ideal marker for determining

                 usefulness of otolith microchemistry for natal origin
                 determination within the same river over a relatively
                 small spatial scale when there are geologic differences

                 protein, and proper water temperature is key to
                 successful fish breeding. The authors of this study
                 evaluated crucian carp growth, mucus antibacterial
                 properties, and immune indicators at 17, 21, 24, 27,
                 and 31 \degree C. The results indicated that in the
                 range of 17--31 \degree C, the resistance of epidermal
                 mucus to \bioname{Vibrio harveyi} decreased with
                 temperature rising. At 24 and 27 \degree C, the
                 activities of lysozyme and catalase significantly
                 increased; alkaline phosphatase activity, superoxide
                 dismutase activity, and total protein concentration
                 first increased and then decreased with rising
                 temperature; the highest values were observed at 24
                 \degree C, with increases of 56.55\%, 26.64\%, and
                 44.52\%, respectively, compared to those under the 17
                 \degree C treatment. When the treatment reached 27
                 \degree C, the temperature had an effect on the growth
                 and antibacterial properties of crucian carp, and the
                 activities of alkaline phosphatase and superoxide
                 dismutase were significantly reduced. At temperatures
                 of 17--24 \degree C, the survival rate of crucian carp
                 could reach more than 93\%, and at the temperature of
                 24 \degree C, the specific growth rate reached the
                 highest value of 43.29\%. Therefore, the most favorable
                 temperature for the long-term breeding of crucian carp
                 was found to be 24 \degree C. This study provides a
                 favorable experimental basis for the establishment of
                 intelligent aquaculture systems and the setting of
                 water environment parameters.",

                 movement is a powerful way to analyze animal behavior.
                 Both humans and fish can judge the physiological state
                 through the skeleton framework. However, it is
                 challenging for farmers to judge the breeding state in
                 the complex underwater environment. Therefore, images
                 can be transmitted by the underwater camera and
                 monitored by a computer vision model. However, it lacks
                 datasets in artificial intelligence and is unable to
                 train deep neural networks. The main contributions of
                 this paper include: (1) the world's first fish posture
                 database is established. 10 key points of each fish are
                 manually marked. The fish flock images were taken in
                 the experimental tank and 1000 single fish images were
                 separated from the fish flock. (2) A two-stage attitude
                 estimation model is used to detect fish key points. The
                 evaluation of the algorithm performance indicates the
                 precision of detection reaches 90.61\%, F1-score

                 Fisheries Policy (Article 15 of the European Regulation
                 No. 1380/2013). This regulation introduced a discard

                 and release. Candidate species should be evaluated for
                 each fishing gear and geographical area. In this study,
                 we assessed not only survival, but also physiological
                 recovery rates of blackspot seabream (\bioname{Pagellus
                 bogaraveo}) below commercial size captured with a
                 hookline called `` voracera '' in the Strait of
                 Gibraltar (SW Atlantic waters of Europe). Experiments
                 onboard a commercial fishing vessel were paralleled

                 where the capture process was mimicked, and
                 physiological recovery markers were described. Our
                 results confirmed that hookline capture induced acute
                 stress responses in the target species, such as changes
                 in plasma cortisol, lactate, glucose, and osmolality.
                 However, 90.6\% of the blackspot seabreams below
                 commercial size captured with this fishing gear managed
                 to survive, and evidenced physiological recovery
                 responses 5 h after capture, with complete homeostatic
                 recovery occurring within the first 24 h. Based on this
                 study, the European Commission approved an exemption
                 from the discard (EU Commission Delegated Regulation
                 6794/2018). Thus, the robust methodology described

                 experimental groups were fed for 60 days with different
                 concentrations of CEO: CTRL (0 mL kg \minus 1 fish
                 feed); CEO1 (1 mL kg \minus 1 fish feed); and CEO2 (2
                 mL kg \minus 1 fish feed). At the end of the

                 were subjected to a challenge with an injection of Poly
                 I:C for immune stimulation. Although S. aurata
                 individuals tolerated CEO inclusion without
                 compromising growth performance, it significantly
                 reduced glycogen in the CEO2 group, concomitant to an
                 increment of total peripheral leucocytes. Moreover,
                 different hematological profiles' responsive patterns
                 against an inflammatory stimulus were observed. In
                 conclusion, our results suggest that the use of CEO as
                 a fish feed additive can prevent bacterial outbreaks
                 and improve potential in vivo disease resistance in S.

                 crop farming to white leg shrimp production is
                 widespread in Vietnam's Mekong Delta provinces.
                 However, this conversion trend also contains many risks
                 related to the technical aspects of the production
                 process. The study mainly aims to estimate the
                 technical efficiency of white leg shrimp farming. It
                 also compares the technical efficiency of white leg
                 shrimp farming between the traditional group that
                 historically has cultivated white leg shrimp and the
                 group that recently converted from black tiger shrimp
                 and crops to white leg shrimp, in order to evaluate the
                 efficiency and adaptability of shrimp farming. Primary
                 data were collected by directly interviewing 99 farmers
                 in traditional areas and 101 farmers in recently
                 converted areas in the study sites and analyzed by
                 using the stochastic frontier method. The calculated
                 technical efficiency was around 72.9 percent,
                 suggesting that farmers could increase their output
                 level by about 27.1\%, given constant inputs. There was
                 no difference in the technical efficiency of the two
                 groups, indicating that the converted farms have
                 sufficient adaptability when switching to white leg
                 shrimp farming. The output loss in farmers' production
                 is still very high, with an average loss of 1973

  abstract =     "Fish often undergo food shortages in nature,
                 especially for juveniles that are relatively vulnerable
                 in most aspects. Therefore, the effects of food
                 deprivation on fish behavior and physiology are worth
                 exploring. Here, we investigated the behavioral and
                 metabolic adaptations of the juvenile black rockfish
                 \bioname{Sebastes schlegelii} to different durations of
                 food deprivation. In this study, three treatments were
                 set: control group, short-term food deprivation (STFD)
                 group, and long-term food deprivation (LTFD) group. The
                 rearing lasted for six weeks. During this period,
                 videos were recorded three times per week to assess the
                 locomotor activity and aggression. After this, the
                 fishes' boldness, neophobia, and aggressiveness were
                 assessed using different behavioral assessment devices,
                 while the standard metabolic rate (SMR) was measured by
                 flow-type respirometry. In general, the values of the
                 four indicators (swimming time, the number of turns,
                 movement number, and attack number) for the STFD group
                 were significantly higher than those for the control
                 and LTFD group during the same period of rearing. In a
                 subsequent personality assessment, the STFD group was
                 observed to be significantly bolder in an assessment
                 measuring boldness than the control and LTFD group
                 (indicated by time in the circle, swimming time, number
                 of times through the circle, and frequency in the
                 circle). The LTFD group was observed to be more
                 exploratory in the assessment of neophobia (indicated
                 by duration in the exploratory area, distance from
                 novelty item, and frequency of stay in the exploratory
                 area). Indeed, the LTFD group was observed to be
                 significantly less aggressive in the assessment of
                 aggressiveness than the control and STFD group
                 (indicated by attack number, attack range frequency,
                 first attack, and winner). SMR was noted to be
                 significantly higher in the STFD group than in the
                 control and LTFD group. In conclusion, this study
                 firstly reported the effects of food deprivation
                 duration on the personalities of black rockfish, as
                 well as the behavioral and physiological mechanisms.
                 Thus, we hope to provide insights into the work of

                 is a representative catadromous invertebrate of the
                 Yangtze River and a commercial species widely
                 cultivated in China. Both cultivated and wild crabs
                 suffer from a variety of parasites and pathogens, which
                 can result in catastrophic economic losses in
                 aquaculture revenue. Polyascus gregaria, a parasitic
                 barnacle with a highly derived morphology, is
                 specialized in invading these crabs. This study
                 examines the immunological mechanism in E. sinensis
                 infected with P. gregaria. Tandem mass tags (TMT), a
                 specialized method of mass-spectrometry, was used to
                 analyze the infection by P. gregaria resistance at the
                 protein level. In the hepatopancreas of infected crabs,
                 598 proteins differentially expressed relating to
                 physiological change, of which, 352 were upregulated
                 and 246 were downregulated. Based on this differential
                 protein expression, 104 GO terms and 13 KEGG pathways
                 were significantly enriched. Differentially expressed
                 proteins, such as ATG, cathepsin, serpin, iron-related
                 protein, Rab family, integrin, and lectin, are
                 associated with the lysosome GO term and the
                 autophagy-animal KEGG pathways, both of which likely
                 relate to the immune response to the parasitic P.
                 gregaria infection. These results show the benefit of
                 taking a detailed, protein-level approach to
                 understanding the innate immune response of aquatic
                 invertebrates to macroparasite infection.",

                 lake virus (TiLV), is an emerging fish virus that
                 primarily affects tilapines. However, the virus has
                 also been detected in a few non-tilapines. As tilapia
                 is generally farmed in polyculture systems along with
                 carps in South Asian countries, there is a likelihood
                 that TiLV-infected tilapia can transmit the virus to
                 the co-cultured species. In view of the above, the
                 susceptibility of three carp species, namely catla
                 (\bioname{Catla catla}), mrigal (\bioname{Cirrhinus
                 mrigala}) and silver carp (\bioname{Hypophthalmichthys
                 molitrix}) was evaluated vis-{\`a}-vis tilapia,
                 following experimental infection with TiLV. No clinical
                 signs and histopathological alterations could be
                 observed in carps. RT-qPCR revealed that TiLV copy
                 numbers in liver and brain of all the three carps were
                 almost negligible and did not show any increase with
                 time, suggesting that the virus did not replicate in
                 liver and brain, the target organs of TiLV. Further,
                 TiLV could not be isolated from pooled liver and brain
                 tissues of carps using permissive CFF cell line. On the
                 contrary, in tilapia, typical clinical signs and
                 histopathological lesions were observed and there was
                 significant increase in TiLV copy number up to 6 days
                 post-injection. Furthermore, the virus was successfully
                 isolated from pooled liver and brain tissue of infected
                 tilapia. From the above findings, it could be concluded
                 that C. catla, C. mrigala and H. molitrix are resistant

                 investigate the association between photoreceptor cells
                 and feeding behavior. Furthermore, the comparison of
                 the prey-tracking ability of M. salmoides with that of
                 other predatory fish (Coreoperca herzi and
                 \bioname{Lepomis macrochirus}) with similar ecological
                 characteristics revealed the structure and arrangement
                 of photoreceptor cells, typical of a predatory fish in
                 M. salmoides. The double and single cone cells in the
                 retina were present in the regular mosaic patterns of
                 the quadrilateral units, with four double cone cells
                 surrounding a single cone cell. The photoreceptor
                 cells, i.e., the rod, single, and double cone cells of
                 M. salmoides, were smaller (2.3 {\pm} 0.2, 3.82 {\pm}
                 0.2, and 7.5 {\pm} 0.2 {\mu}m, respectively) than those
                 of other species (3.1 {\pm} 0.24, 6.6 {\pm} 0.5, and
                 11.3 {\pm} 0.4 {\mu}m in diameter, respectively, in C.
                 herzi). A smaller diameter of cone cells allows for a
                 high-density arrangement of visual cells, possibly
                 affecting the dynamic visual acuity for prey
                 tracking.",

                 Aeromonas septicemia, caused by virulent
                 \bioname{Aeromonas hydrophila} (vAh), is one of the
                 most severe diseases that afflict catfish farms.
                 Previously, vaccination of fish with extracellular
                 proteins (ECP) of vAh was shown to produce a robust
                 antibody-mediated immune response against vAh
                 infection. In this study, we analyzed IgM transcripts
                 that were differentially expressed in the head kidney
                 and liver of ECP-immunized and mock-immunized (control)
                 fish with emphasis on a variable domain of heavy chain.
                 Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that immunized fish
                 produced significantly more IgM transcripts than
                 control fish. Full-length IgM heavy chain cDNA was
                 cloned, which encoded typical IgM peptide, including
                 signal peptide, variable domain (VH), constant domain
                 (CH), and carboxyl terminal peptide. Great sequence
                 diversity was revealed in a VH segment, with the third
                 complementarity diversity region (CDR3) being most
                 variable. Using germline VH gene grouping method,
                 variants (clones) of VH characterized in this study
                 belonged to nine VH families. The most unique variants
                 (approximately 49\%) were found in the VH2 family.
                 Vaccinated fish apparently had more unique variants
                 than in the control fish. There were 62\% and 79\% of
                 unique variants in the head kidney and liver of
                 vaccinated fish, respectively, while 44\% and 27\%
                 unique variants in the head kidney and liver of control
                 fish, respectively. Among the unique variants in VH2
                 family, approximately 87\% of them were found in
                 vaccinated fish. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of
                 semi-purified IgM protein confirmed that matured IgM
                 protein was as variable as IgM transcripts identified
                 in this study, with isoelectric points crossing from 6
                 to 10. Results of this study provided insight into the
                 molecular and genetic basis of antibody diversity and

  abstract =     "Coilia grayii is the anadromous form of anchovy that
                 is distributed in the East and South China Seas. It is
                 a common fish species in the estuarine area of the
                 Pearl River. Nevertheless, freshwater populations
                 appear upstream in the Pearl River, but the migratory
                 pathway has been mostly impeded by dam construction.
                 Behavioral differences and constrained habitat within
                 tributaries are suspected of promoting genetic
                 divergence in these populations. In this study, we
                 investigated the migratory behavior and genetic
                 divergence of six populations of C. grayii fragmented
                 by dams based on the otolith strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca)
                 ratio, mitochondrial DNA, and microsatellite
                 genotyping. All populations were in freshwater with low
                 Sr/Ca ratios, except the estuarine population (Humen
                 population) hatched in brackish water. Reduced
                 nucleotide diversity corresponding to distance was
                 observed. Populations from distant hydrological regions
                 exhibited a decline in genetic diversity and a
                 significant difference with the remaining populations
                 after fitting the isolation by distance model. Pairwise
                 fixation indices confirmed these results and moderate
                 and significant differentiation was found between
                 Hengxian site and downstream sites. Furthermore,
                 STRUCTURE analyses revealed that all separated
                 populations exhibited an admixed phylogenetic pattern
                 except for individuals from the Hengxian locality. The
                 upstream sites showed significantly increased
                 resistance to gene flow from the estuarine population
                 because of isolation by the dam. The results of the
                 neutrality test and Bayesian skyline plots demonstrated
                 complex demography---individuals' experienced
                 historical expansion and partial upper-dam populations
                 had recently undergone a colonization, forming a new
                 genetic structure. Accordingly, this study demonstrates
                 differences in the migration pattern and genetic
                 differentiation of C. grayii as a consequence of
                 demographic history and current processes (habitat

                 the welfare of rainbow trout in relation to inadequate
                 husbandry conditions. A feeding stress model based on
                 dietary soybean meal was employed to identify suitable
                 minimally invasive ``classical'' stress markers,
                 together with molecular signatures. In a 56-day feeding
                 experiment, rainbow trout were fed diets containing
                 different levels of soybean meal. The impact of these
                 different soybean meal diets on rainbow trout was
                 assessed by water quality analyses, clinical health
                 observations, classic growth and performance
                 parameters, gut histopathology, blood-parameter
                 measurements and multigene-expression profiling in RNA
                 from whole blood. Soybean meal-induced enteritis was
                 manifested phenotypically by an inflammatory reaction
                 in the posterior section of the intestine and by
                 diarrhoea in some trout. These inflammatory changes
                 were associated with decreased supranuclear
                 vacuolation. The haematocrit values and the levels of
                 plasma cortisol and circulating lymphocytes in the
                 blood were increased in trout that had consumed high
                 amounts of SBM. Notably, the increased haematocrit
                 depended significantly on the bodyweight of the
                 individual trout. The transcript levels of certain
                 genes (e.g., MAP3K1, LYG, NOD1, STAT1 and HSP90AB)
                 emerged as potentially useful indicators in the blood
                 of rainbow trout providing valuable information about
                 inadequate nutrition. The expression-profiling findings
                 provide a basis for improved, minimally invasive
                 monitoring of feeding regimens in trout farming and may

                 potential to dominate fish community biomass in their

                 RDE analysis was used to assess the variation of both
                 catch and CPUE of commercial fish species, while the
                 percentages of bottom sediment type coverage, average
                 depth, annual salinity, and water residence time in
                 each of the fishing squares were used as explanatory
                 variables. This distance e-based redundancy analysis
                 allowed for the use of non-Euclidean dissimilarity
                 indices. Fisheries data spatial distribution map
                 indicated the lack of coherence between the spatial
                 patterns of commercial catches and CPUE distribution in
                 the northern part of the lagoon. Highest CPUE values
                 were estimated in the central-eastern part of the
                 lagoon as compared to the western part of the lagoon
                 where CPUE values were substantially lower. Both total
                 catch and CPUE appeared not to be related to the type
                 of bottom habitats statistically while being spatially
                 correlated in-between. However, the impact of salinity
                 and water residence time calculated using the 3D
                 hydraulic circulation model on the distribution of both
                 CPUE and commercial catches was statistically
                 significant.",

  abstract =     "Diseases of crucian carp (\bioname{Carassius auratus})
                 are closely related to intestinal parameters.
                 Enterococcus faecalis has strong colonization ability
                 in the intestinal tract, and produces natural
                 antibiotics, bacteriocin, and other bacteriostatic
                 substances, which can effectively inhibit some
                 pathogenic bacteria and improve the intestinal
                 microenvironment. This study aimed to assess the
                 effects of E. faecalis YFI-G720 which was isolated from
                 the intestinal of crucian carp on the growth, immunity,
                 intestinal health, and disease resistance of crucian
                 carp. Fish (48.16 {\pm} 0.55 g) were fed four diets,
                 commercial diet or diet containing E. faecalis at 10 5
                 CFU/g (EF1), 10 6 CFU/g (EF2), or 10 7 CFU/g (EF3) for
                 28 days. The results showed that supplementation of E.
                 faecalis significantly improved the weight gain ratio
                 (WGR) and the specific growth rate (SGR) compared with
                 control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Intestinal mucosal
                 epithelial cells in EF2 were intact and normal, but
                 there was obvious vacuolation in CG. Compared with CG,
                 serum C3 and IgM in EF2 were significantly increased at
                 the end of the experiment (p {$<$} 0.05), and serum
                 alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in all
                 experimental groups (p {$<$} 0.05). Among studied
                 immune-related genes, expression was detected by qPCR,
                 C3, IgM, and IL-1{\beta}were upregulated in all
                 experimental groups to varying degrees from 14 days,
                 with highest expression in EF2 at 28 days. Intestinal
                 microbiota structure analyzed through high-throughput
                 sequencing, and the results showed that the relative
                 abundance of Aeromonas and Acinetobacter decreased
                 while Cetobacterium increased in all experimental
                 groups, with the greatest changes in EF2. Challenge
                 tests showed that fish fed E. faecalis were more
                 resistant to \bioname{Aeromonas veronii} (p {$<$}
                 0.05). In conclusion, dietary E. faecalis YFI-G720 at
                 10 6 CFU/g can improve the health status, immune
                 parameters, intestinal microbiota composition, and
                 disease resistance of crucian carp.",

  abstract =     "Large yellow croaker (\bioname{Larimichthys crocea}),
                 an economically important marine fish in China, has
                 suffered from serious vibriosis, which has resulted in
                 great economic losses for the large yellow croaker
                 industry. Vaccination has been considered to be a safe
                 and effective method to prevent and control vibriosis.
                 However, due to the complex diversity and serotypes of
                 the Vibrio genus, the progress of Vibrio vaccine
                 development is still slow. In this study, we prepared
                 recombinant Vibrio dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase
                 (rDLD) protein and investigated its potential as a
                 candidate to be a subunit vaccine against Vibrio. The
                 lysozyme activity and the rDLD-specific antibody level
                 in sera of large yellow croakers immunized with rDLD
                 were significantly higher than those in the control
                 group, and the transcript levels of proinflammatory
                 cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{\beta}), MHC
                 II{\alpha}/{\beta}, CD40, CD8{\alpha}, IL-4/13A, and
                 IL-4/13B were significantly up-regulated in the spleen
                 and head kidney of large yellow croakers immunized with
                 rDLD, suggesting that rDLD could induce both specific
                 and nonspecific immune responses in this species. In
                 addition, rDLD protein increased the survival rate of
                 large yellow croakers against \bioname{Vibrio
                 alginolyticus} and \bioname{Vibrio parahaemolyticus},
                 with the relative percent of survival (RPS) being
                 74.5\% and 66.9\%, respectively. These results will
                 facilitate the development of a potential subunit

  abstract =     "In ectotherm species, environmental temperature plays
                 a key role in development, growth, and survival. Thus,
                 determining how temperature affects fish populations is
                 of utmost importance to accurately predict the risk of
                 climate change over fisheries and aquaculture, critical
                 to warrant nutrition and food security in the coming
                 years. Here, the potential effects of abnormal thermal
                 regimes (24, 28 and 32 {$^\circ $}C; TR24, TR28, and
                 TR32, respectively) exclusively applied during
                 embryogenesis in tropical gar (\bioname{Atractosteus
                 tropicus}) has been explored to decipher the potential
                 consequences on hatching and growth from fertilization
                 to 16 days post-fertilization (dpf), while effects on
                 skeletal development and body morphology were explored
                 at fertilization and 16 dpf. Egg incubation at higher
                 temperatures induced an early hatching and mouth
                 opening. A higher hatching rate was obtained in eggs
                 incubated at 28 {$^\circ $}C when compared to those at
                 24 {$^\circ $}C. No differences were found in fish
                 survival at 16 dpf, with values ranging from 84.89 to
                 88.86\%, but increased wet body weight and standard
                 length were found in larvae from TR24 and TR32 groups.
                 Thermal regime during embryogenesis also altered the
                 rate at which the skeletal development occurs. Larvae
                 from the TR32 group showed an advanced skeletal
                 development, with a higher development of cartilaginous
                 structures at hatching but reduced at 16 dpf when
                 compared with the TR24 and TR28 groups. Furthermore,
                 this advanced skeletal development seemed to determine
                 the fish body morphology. Based on biometric measures,
                 a principal component analysis showed how along
                 development, larvae from each thermal regime were
                 clustered together, but with each population remaining
                 clearly separated from each other. The current study
                 shows how changes in temperature may induce
                 craniofacial and morphological alterations in fish
                 during early stages and contribute to understanding the
                 possible effects of global warming in early development
                 of fish and its ecological implications.",

                 a 2011 bigeye croaker stock biomass estimate of 14,412
                 t. The viable solution indicated a reduction in stock

  abstract =     "Fisheries in the Curonian Lagoon (1584 km 2 coastal
                 lagoon in South-East Baltic) can be classified as
                 artisanal, small-scale, multi-species, and multi-gear.
                 Such types of fisheries are characterised as data-poor
                 and require appropriate investigation methods. We used
                 CMSY (version CMSY\_2019\_9f. R) to assess maximum
                 sustainable yield (MSY) and related indicators for
                 freshwater bream, roach, pike-perch, and European
                 perch. A decline in pike-perch and roach was
                 identified, while the stocks of freshwater bream and
                 European perch were sustained. As the CMSY model does
                 not consider the impact of environmental factors, the
                 decline in roach stock may be attributed to the
                 increase in salinity rather than to overfishing. In the
                 case of freshwater bream and pike-perch, the method
                 cannot consider the increase of the percentage of
                 small-sized fishes in catches due to the allowance of
                 low-selectivity gears in the fishery. Additionally, in
                 the case of the pike-perch, the model does not take
                 into account the interannual fluctuations in the
                 stock-recruitment system. The assessment of the
                 European perch stock can be considered to be good.
                 However, the accuracy of CMSY is limited, and it should
                 be used for fisheries management only in combination
                 with other methods.",

  abstract =     "To be as accurate as possible, stock assessments
                 should account for discard mortality in fisheries if it
                 occurs. Three common approaches to modeling discards in
                 assessments are to lump dead discards with landings,
                 treat dead discards as their own fleet, or link them
                 conversely with landings through use of a retention
                 function. The first approach (lumping) implicitly
                 assumes that the selectivity of landings applies also
                 to discards. In many cases, that assumption is false,
                 for example, if discards comprise smaller fish than do
                 landings. The latter two approaches avoid the
                 assumption by modeling discards explicitly with their
                 own selectivity pattern. Here, we examine these
                 approaches to modeling discards. Using a simulation
                 study, we demonstrate that the two approaches to
                 modeling discards explicitly can provide identical
                 results under both static and time-varying conditions.
                 Then, using a stock assessment case study of red
                 grouper \bioname{Epinephelus morio} in the U.S. Gulf of
                 Mexico, we demonstrate that in practice the approaches
                 to modeling discards can provide different outcomes,
                 with implications for the resultant management advice.
                 We conclude by comparing and contrasting the different
                 approaches, calling for more research to elucidate
                 which approach is most suitable under various sources
                 of error typically encountered in discard data.",

                 it is practiced by a farmer as mini-livestock in the
                 vicinity of Andong in Korea. We visited the snail farm
                 several times in the summer and winter of the year and
                 conducted interviews with the farm manager using a
                 semi-structured questionnaire. The farm is housed in
                 polythene tunnels and uses a tank pen of trench type
                 made up of propylene and measuring 1 m $ \times $ 2 m $
                 \times $ 0.5 m (length $ \times $ width $ \times $
                 height) in size. A regulated inflow of fresh water and
                 outflow of used water was installed, with water level
                 not exceeding 5 to 7 cm. As feed of snails, commercial
                 fish feed is generally provided. The life cycle of the
                 P. canaliculata might differ in captivity under the
                 controlled environmental conditions than that of an
                 individual in the wild environment. The farming system
                 of snails, particularly P. canaliculata, does not
                 involve high labor-intensive, high capital investment
                 and also does not require high through-put cutting edge
                 technology. In addition to providing nutrient-dense
                 snail meat, establishing a snailery could therefore
                 augment the economic condition of farmers in the poorer
                 regions of the world and encourage sustainability and
                 biodiversity conservation.",

  abstract =     "The Chinese razor clam (\bioname{Sinonovacula
                 constricta}), a bivalve species widely distributed in
                 estuaries and mudflats, is often exposed to extreme
                 environmental and microbial stresses. Histones are
                 fundamental components of chromatin and play an
                 important role in innate immunity, as demonstrated by
                 its antimicrobial activities in clams. However, little
                 attention has been paid to histones in bivalves. To
                 fill this gap, we investigated the genomic
                 distribution, structural characteristics, conserved
                 motifs, and phylogenetic relationships of histones in
                 S. constricta. A total of 114 histone genes were
                 detected in the S. constricta genome, which were
                 divided into 25 types in phylogenetic analysis. Among
                 them, partial histones exhibited a tissue-dependent
                 expression pattern, indicating that they may be
                 involved in sustaining the homeostasis of
                 organs/tissues in adult S. constricta. Furthermore,
                 mRNA expression of certain histones changed
                 significantly in S. constricta when infected with
                 \bioname{Vibrio parahaemolyticus}, suggesting that
                 histones play a role in the immune defense of S.
                 constricta. All together, this study on histone genes
                 in S. constricta not only greatly expands our knowledge
                 of histone function in the clam, but also histone
                 evolution in molluscs.",

                 intracellular molecules involved in the function of the
                 immune system. Their secretion is induced by various
                 infectious stimuli. Cytokine release by host cells has
                 been extensively used as a powerful tool for studying
                 immune reactions in the early stages of viral and

                 human-induced pressures. In the marine realm, one of
                 the major threats to species conservation, together
                 with climate change, is overfishing. In this context,
                 having information on the conservation status of target
                 commercial marine fish species becomes crucial for
                 assuring safe standards. We put together fisheries
                 statistics from the FAO, the IUCN Red List, FishBase,
                 and RAM Legacy databases to understand to what extent
                 top commercial species' conservation status has been
                 assessed. Levels of assessment for top-fished species
                 were higher than those for general commercial or highly
                 commercial species, but almost half of the species have
                 outdated assessments. We found no relation between IUCN
                 Red List traits and FishBase Vulnerability Index,
                 depreciating the latter value as a guidance for
                 extinction threat. The RAM database suggests good
                 management of more-threatened species in recent
                 decades, but more data are required to assess whether
                 the trend has reverted in recent years. Outdated IUCN
                 Red List assessments can benefit from reputed stock
                 assessments for new reassessments. The future of IUCN
                 Red List evaluations for commercial fish species relies
                 on integrating new parameters from fisheries sources
                 and improved collaboration with fisheries stakeholders

                 harm to monitoring targets. Environmental DNA has
                 become a common tool for the assessment and monitoring
                 of aquatic organisms. In this study, we investigated
                 fish resources in the Yangtze River mainstream using
                 environmental DNA, and the variations in fish during
                 two seasons (spring and autumn) were compared. The
                 results showed that 13 species were identified in
                 spring, and nine species of fish were identified in
                 autumn. The fish with higher eDNA detection were
                 Sinibotia superciliaris, \bioname{Tachysurus

                 variation between spring and autumn was not

                 different effects on fish assemblages during the two

                 the composition of fish in the spring and autumn in the
                 Yangtze River mainstream, providing a new technology
                 for the long-term management and protection of fishery
                 resources in the region. Of course, problems such as
                 pollution and insufficient databases are the current
                 shortcomings of environmental DNA, which will be the
                 focus of our future research and study.",

                 Adriatic Sea, as the northernmost region of the
                 Mediterranean. A total of 113 specimens (59 females, 53
                 males, and one individual of indeterminate sex),
                 ranging from 23.4 to 42.5 cm in total length, were
                 analyzed. The maximum observed age was 5 years for both
                 females and males, and this barracuda population was
                 dominated by 3 year old fish. Growth was described by
                 the von Bertalanffy growth curve (L {\infty} = 55.58
                 cm, K = 0.12 year {$-$1}, t 0 = {$-$4}.29 year, R 2 =

                 relationships between observed fish age and otolith
                 morphometrics. In comparison with age and growth data
                 available in the literature for S. sphyraena, our
                 results from the Adriatic Sea provide more insights
                 into the life-history traits of this species and can be

                 considered a threat to the aquatic environment. In
                 addition to common industrial pollutants, levels of
                 pharmaceuticals have been increasingly found in the
                 environment in recent years, which may present a strong
                 risk to the aquatic species that live there. The
                 constant consumption of biologically active chemicals
                 for human health has been matched by an increase in the
                 leaking of these compounds in natural habitats over the
                 last two decades. This study is aimed at evaluating the
                 developmental toxicity of fotemustine in the ecological
                 environment. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to doses of
                 25, 50 and 100 $ \mu $ g/mL from 4 h post-fertilization
                 to 120 h. This study confirms that fotemustine exposure
                 at 50 and 100 $ \mu $ g/mL affects the survival and
                 hatching rate, morphology score and body length.
                 Additionally, it significantly disturbs the antioxidant
                 defense system and increases ROS in zebrafish larvae.
                 From the molecular point of view, fotemustine exposure
                 strongly induces apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum

                 important role in physiological function. The study of
                 fish scale development mechanisms provides a basis for
                 exploring the molecular-level developmental differences
                 between scaled and non-scaled fishes. In this study,
                 alizarin red staining was used to divide the different
                 stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) scale development.
                 Four developmental stages, namely stage I ($ \approx
                 $17 dpf, scales have not started to grow), stage II ($
                 \approx $33 dpf, the point at which scales start to
                 grow), stage III ($ \approx $41 dpf, the period in
                 which the scales almost cover the whole body), and
                 stage IV ($ \approx $3 mpf, scales cover the whole
                 body), were determined and used for subsequent
                 transcriptome analysis. WGCNA (weighted correlation
                 network analysis) and DEG (differentially expressed
                 gene) analysis were used for screening the key genes.
                 Based on the comparison between stage II and stage I,
                 54 hub-genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. Key
                 genes including the Scpp family (Scpp7, Scpp6, Scpp5,
                 and Scpp8), the Fgf family (Fgfr1b and Fgfr3), Tcf7,
                 Wnt10b, Runx2b, and Il2rb were identified by DEG
                 analysis, which indicated that these genes played
                 important roles in the key nodes of scale development
                 signal pathways. Combined with this analysis, the
                 TGF-{\beta}, Wnt/{\beta}-catenin, and FGF signaling
                 pathways were suggested to be the most important signal
                 pathways for scales starting to grow. This study laid a
                 foundation for exploring the scale development
                 mechanism of other fishes. The scale development
                 candidate genes identified in the current study will

                 of the host's immune system was seen in the first few
                 hours post-infection (6 to 9 hpi), as evidenced by an

                 from eggs immediately after fertilization to hatching.
                 The protein levels in the eggs gradually increased with
                 development until the completion of hatching. In
                 contrast, the triglyceride (TG) and free amino acid

  abstract =     "The vasa gene is essential for germ cell development
                 and gametogenesis both in vertebrates and in
                 invertebrates. In the present study, vasa (Rcvasa) cDNA
                 was cloned from cobia (Rachycentron canadum) using the
                 RACE amplification method. We found that the
                 full-length cDNA sequence of Rcvasa comprises 2571 bp,
                 containing a 5{\prime}-UTR of 145 bp, a 3{\prime}-UTR
                 of 341 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2085 bp,
                 encoding a protein of 694 aa. The deduced amino acid
                 sequence contains 8 conserved motifs of the DEAD-box
                 protein family, 7 RGG repeats, and 10 RG repeats in the
                 N-terminal region. Comparisons of the deduced amino
                 acid sequence with those of other teleosts revealed the
                 highest percentage identity (86.0\%) with Seriola
                 quinqueradiata. By using semiquantitative RT-PCR,
                 Rcvasa appeared to be specifically expressed in the
                 testis and ovary, among 13 tissues analyzed. In
                 addition, annual changes in Rcvasa expression levels
                 were examined in the gonads by quantitative real-time
                 PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of Rcvasa in the testis
                 first increased significantly at 120 dph (stage
                 II--III), then stabilized as the testis developed from
                 185 dph (stage III) to 360 dph (stage V). During the
                 development of the ovary (stage I to II), the
                 expression of Rcvasa first increased and reached the
                 highest level at 210 dph (stage II), then decreased.
                 Furthermore, the results of chromogenic in situ
                 hybridization (CISH) revealed that Rcvasa mRNA was
                 mainly expressed in germ cells and barely detected in
                 somatic cells. In the testis, Rcvasa mRNA signal was
                 concentrated in the periphery of spermatogonia, primary
                 spermatocytes, and secondary spermatocytes and was
                 significantly weaker in spermatids and spermatozoa. In
                 the ovary, Rcvasa mRNA signal was uniformly distributed
                 in the perinuclear cytoplasm and was intense in early
                 primary oocytes (stage I and II). These findings could
                 provide a reference for understanding the regulatory
                 mechanisms of vasa expression during the development of
                 germ cells in cobia.",

                 stress-related gene expressions. Four isolipidic diets:
                 two fishmeal-based (FM) and two plant feedstuff
                 (PF)-based diets, with P/CH ratios of 50/10 or 40/20
                 each (FM-P50/CH10; FM-P40/CH20; PF-P50/CH10;
                 PF-P40/CH20), were tested. PF-based diets lead to more
                 histomorphological alterations than FM-based diets.
                 P/CH ratio had no relevant effect on gut
                 histomorphology. Gut mucosa of fish fed PF-based diets
                 presented a higher number of operational taxonomic
                 units, and richness and diversity indices, while the
                 P/CH ratio did not affect those parameters. The
                 {\alpha}-amylase activity was lower in fish fed with
                 PF-based diets and in fish fed the P40/CH20 diets.
                 Regarding the immune-related genes, only
                 cyclooxygenase-2 was affected, being higher in fish fed
                 the P50/CH10 diets than the P40/CH20 diets. Fish fed
                 the FM-based diets presented higher expression of
                 glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, while
                 fish fed the P50/CH10 diet had higher expression of
                 superoxide dismutase. In conclusion, PF-based diets can
                 compromise gut absorptive and digestive metabolism, but
                 decreasing the dietary P/CH ratio had little effect on
                 the parameters measured.",

                 analyses of species presence. The total number of
                 species recorded in the Adriatic is 449. The Adriatic
                 has 58.8\% of Mediterranean species richness, 76.1\% of
                 its families, and 87.8\% of its orders. Among species
                 discovered in the Adriatic after 2010, twelve species
                 were attributed to biological invasion, mostly Atlantic
                 immigrants or alien species, and ten species were
                 attributed to improved research on the native
                 ichthyofauna of the Adriatic area. About 58\% of
                 species are native species of Atlanto-Mediterranean
                 origin, 21\% are native species of wider global
                 occurrence, 15\% are Mediterranean or Mediterranean and
                 Black Sea endemics and 5\% originated outside
                 Mediterranean Sea. The majority of species inhabit the
                 benthic environment (71.9\%), while others occur in the
                 pelagic environment (20.7\%) or are euryhaline (7.3\%).
                 The benthic littoral species are the most numerous
                 Adriatic fishes, representing 40\% of all species
                 richness, whereas pelagic fishes are mainly eurybathic
                 or epipelagic; only 3.6\% of species are deep pelagic
                 species. A Red Book of marine fishes of the Adriatic
                 Sea is urgently needed to assess their conservation
                 status, covering the entire Adriatic Sea and reviewing

                 from laboratory-reared larval and juvenile
                 Sinogastromyzon wui (S. wui, 0 to 25 days
                 post-hatching) that were obtained as eggs from the
                 Shilong Reach of Xijiang River between April and August
                 2021. We observed the development of the three pairs of
                 otoliths (lapilli, sagittae, and asterisci) and
                 compared the shape changes and growth of the lapilli
                 and sagittae, as well as the timing and deposition rate
                 of increments of the lapilli. The lapilli and the
                 sagittae were visible on hatching, whereas the
                 asterisci were present at four days post-hatching
                 (dph). The shape of the sagitta changed more obviously
                 than that of the lapillus, and a strong correlation was
                 observed between sagitta shape changes and fish
                 ontogenesis. The otolith shape greatly modulated during
                 the post-flexion larval stage (Post-FLS), it
                 corresponded with the formation period of individual
                 fins. Analysis of the microstructural features
                 indicated that lapilli were the optimal otolith for age

                 confirmation. Using regression analysis of the known
                 age and the number of lapillus daily increments, we
                 demonstrated that the lapillus developmental increments
                 were deposited daily, and the first increment formed at
                 two days post-hatching. Our conclusions support
                 employing the lapillus increment deposition rate and
                 the time of the first daily increments in the

  abstract =     "In recent years, much attention has been focused on
                 the impact of climate change, particularly via ocean
                 acidification (OA), on marine organisms. Studying the
                 impact of OA on long-living organisms, such as sharks,
                 is especially challenging. When the ocean waters absorb
                 anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2), slow-growing shark
                 species with long generation times may be subjected to
                 stress, leading to a decrease in functionality. Our
                 goal was to examine the behavioral and physiological
                 responses of sharks to OA and the possible impacts on
                 their fitness and resilience. We conducted a systematic
                 review in line with PRISMA-Analyses, of previously
                 reported scientific experiments. We found that most
                 studies used CO 2 partial pressures (pCO 2) that
                 reflect representative concentration pathways for the
                 year 2100 (e.g., pH $ \approx $7.8, pCO 2 $ \approx
                 $1000 {\mu}atm). Since there is a considerable
                 knowledge gap on the effect of OA on sharks, we
                 utilized existing data on bony fish to synthesize the
                 available knowledge. Given the similarities between the
                 behaviors and physiology of these two superclasses' to
                 changes in CO 2 and pH levels, there is merit in
                 including the available information on bony fish as
                 well. Several studies indicated a decrease in shark
                 fitness in relation to increased OA and CO 2 levels.
                 However, the decrease was species-specific and
                 influenced by the intensity of the change in
                 atmospheric CO 2 concentration and other anthropogenic
                 and environmental factors (e.g., fishing, temperature).
                 Most studies involved only limited exposure to future
                 environmental conditions and were conducted on benthic
                 shark species studied in the laboratory rather than on
                 apex predator species. While knowledge gaps exist, and
                 more research is required, we conclude that
                 anthropogenic factors are likely contributing to shark
                 species' vulnerability worldwide. However, the impact
                 of OA on the long-term stability of shark populations
                 is not unequivocal.",

                 material that can replace fish meal to solve the
                 shortage of animal protein. To improve the utilization
                 of FSM, we optimized the co-fermentation conditions of
                 soybean meal using Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus
                 faecium and studied the effects of replacing fish meal
                 with different proportions of FSM on serum antioxidant
                 indices and gut microbiota (GM) composition of crucian
                 carp (Carassius auratus). Our results showed that the
                 co-fermentation of soybean meal was the most effective
                 when the ratio of B. subtilis X-2 and E. faecium X-4
                 was 2:3, glucose addition was 4.5\%, KH 2 PO 4 addition

                 fermentation time was 120 h, and the solid--water ratio
                 was 1:1. Replacing 40\% fish meal with FSM in the feed
                 significantly improved the serum T-AOC, POD, and IgM
                 levels in C. auratus. Although there were significant
                 differences in the midgut and hindgut microbiota
                 structures of C. auratus, the addition of FSM to the
                 feed did not cause significant differences in the GM
                 structure, whether in the midgut or hindgut. Therefore,
                 40\% FSM is the most suitable substitute for fish meal
                 in the feed of C. auratus.",

                 activities. A total of 208,121 specimens and 1281
                 trawls were studied throughout the course of 13 years
                 of shrimp size composition. To investigate differences
                 in length composition between fishing grounds, months,
                 and depth, a PERMANOVA analysis was employed. A
                 geographic information system was developed for
                 environmental characterisation and spatiotemporal trawl
                 fleet distribution. Our findings show that the
                 industrial trawl shrimp fleet has a close relationship

                 locations, and depths during different stages of their

                 cohorts. The management measures of limiting effort
                 (number of vessels) appear enough to avoid
                 overcapitalisation, but the closed period and a
                 proposed no-take fishing zone appear insufficient for
                 what was originally proposed. Ecosystem-based
                 management strategies should be addressed immediately
                 because they would be far more effective than

                 immunological role of HSPs from Schizothorax prenanti
                 (S. prenanti), Sp HSP60 was cloned for the first time
                 in this study, and the gene expressions of Sp HSP27, Sp
                 HSP60, Sp HSP70 and Sp HSP90 in the hepatopancreas,
                 head kidney, hindgut and spleen were analyzed by
                 quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) after treatment with
                 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The open reading frame of the
                 Sp HSP60 gene (GenBank accession number ON245159) is
                 1728 bp. It encodes a protein of 575 amino acids. Its
                 C-terminus is a highly conserved and repeated glycine
                 sequence, which is an important cofactor in ATP
                 binding. Compared with the control group, most of the
                 Sp HSPs were significantly upregulated in the tissues
                 examined at 12 or 24 h after LPS challenge. The most
                 abundant expression of Sp HSP70 was found in the head
                 kidney at 24 h after LPS injection, followed by Sp
                 HSP27 in the spleen at 24 h; both of these Sp HSPs
                 displayed strong expression under the LPS stresses,
                 about 20--70 fold more than that of Sp HSP60 and Sp
                 HSP90. The temporal expression patterns of the four Sp
                 HSP genes were different in the four tissues examined.
                 Taken together, the results suggest that Sp HSP27, Sp
                 HSP60, Sp HSP70 and Sp HSP90 participate in innate
                 immunity stimulated by LPS, and the response intensity
                 of the Sp HSPs was organ-specific, indicating they
                 could provide early warning information against
                 bacterial infection. The findings in our study will
                 contribute to better understanding the biological
                 processes and important roles of Sp HSPs involved in

                 expression of intestinal barrier function genes in
                 tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus) larvae. A total of
                 960 larvae (0.030 {\pm} 0.006 g) were fed three diets
                 supplemented with increasing FOS concentrations (2.5,
                 5, and 7.5 g kg {$-$1}) and a control diet for 15 days.
                 Results revealed that a 7.5 g kg {$-$1} FOS
                 supplementation improved weight gain, specific growth
                 rate, and survival rate (p {$<$} 0.05). Furthermore, 5
                 g kg {$-$1} FOS supplementation increased alkaline
                 protease and amylase activities and induced an
                 upregulation of the claudin-17 gene expression (p {$<$}
                 0.05). Meanwhile, the inclusion of 7.5 g kg {$-$1} FOS
                 induced the upregulation of mucin 2 (muc-2), and the
                 tight junction genes zo-2 and claudin-3 (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 In addition, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 g kg {$-$1} FOS promoted
                 the downregulation of the claudin-15 gene expression (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). At the same time, FOS inclusion did not
                 increase the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 expression.
                 We can conclude that 7.5 g kg {$-$1} FOS
                 supplementation improves growth performance, survival
                 rate, and digestive capacity, and could contribute to

  abstract =     "Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays), which have peculiar
                 and vulnerable life-history traits, are highly
                 threatened by fishing activities. Indeed, between 53\%
                 and 71\% of Mediterranean elasmobranch species are at
                 risk of extinction. In this context, using the
                 abundance MSY (AMSY) model, the present study provides
                 an assessment of 20 batoids and 16 shark species in the
                 Strait of Sicily, sampled during a bottom trawl survey
                 from 1995 to 2020. Overall, the outputs underline a
                 progressively improving condition for shark and ray
                 assemblages of both shelf and eurybathic zones. As for
                 slope-dwelling species, a horseshoe-shaped dynamic,
                 characterized by a progressive decrease in relative
                 harvesting pressure and an increase in relative biomass
                 followed by an increase in fishing pressure and
                 decrease in biomass, was detected. The dynamics of the
                 Elasmobranchii living in the Strait of Sicily appear to
                 be affected by changes in the fishing patterns of
                 trawlers, showing a shift from shallow water to bathyal
                 fishing grounds and targeting deep-water red shrimp. In
                 this context, it seems wise to limit the impact of
                 deep-water fisheries on Elasmobranchii by reducing
                 fishing efforts and implementing ad hoc management
                 measures aimed at safeguarding these vulnerable
                 species.",

  abstract =     "Given the European eel population's marked decrease
                 since the 1980s, it has become urgent to collect
                 information describing its regional population
                 structure to improve management plans. The Minho River
                 (NW-Portugal, SW-Europe) is an important basin for the
                 eel at the southern limit of its distribution, but the
                 species is poorly described. Thus, we aimed to study
                 the structure of the European eel population in the
                 Minho River using otolith shape analysis, which has
                 proven to be effective in discriminating fish groups
                 experiencing different environmental conditions through
                 ontogeny. Our results showed complete discrimination
                 between the two main types of habitats studied
                 (tributaries and estuaries). Otoliths of eels from the
                 estuary were rectangular and elliptic, whereas in the
                 tributaries they presented a more round and circular
                 form. Eels collected in both habitats were mostly
                 yellow-stage eels with a similar age range, but the
                 eels from the tributaries showed smaller length-at-age
                 and lower body condition than those collected in the
                 estuary. Additionally, the sex ratio was skewed towards
                 males in the tributaries and females in the estuary.
                 This study reveals that there are at least two distinct
                 groups of eels in this basin, likely with different
                 development characteristics.",

                 activity in silver catfish, and its nanoemulsion
                 intensified the sedative activity. Supplementation of
                 1.0 mL CCEO per kg of diet for 60 days increased

                 of this EO. Dietary supplementation of CCEO for 30 and
                 60 days also showed an antioxidant effect, as it
                 decreased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive

                 the physiological processes of fish and the overall
                 wellbeing of fishery-dependent people. To cope with the
                 effects of fluctuating fishery resources due to climate
                 change, fishery-dependent people have adopted several
                 adaptation strategies including livelihood
                 diversification, changing their fishing gear,
                 increasing their fishing efforts, and targeting new
                 species. Several management attempts have been made to
                 enhance the sustainability of fishery resources, from
                 local to regional levels. This study recommends the
                 participation of the resource users in the formulation
                 of policies aimed at promoting climate change
                 adaptation and the resilience of freshwater fisheries
                 for sustainable development.",

                 its ligand is closely related to the immune function in
                 animals; however, there are only a few reports on role
                 of XCR1 in the immune system of fish. We aimed to
                 analyze the expression of XCR1 in various organs or
                 tissues of grass carp before and after Grass Carp
                 Reovirus (GCRV) infection to better understand the
                 function of XCR1 in resistance to GCRV infection. We
                 cloned and sequenced the cDNA of grass carp XCR1 and
                 analyzed the molecular structure of XCR1 based its
                 amino acid sequence. Further, we analyzed the relative
                 expression levels of XCR1 in different organs or
                 tissues of male parent grass carp with GCRV resistance
                 (P1) and their first-generation offspring (F1) before
                 and after GCRV infection. Our results show that the
                 total length of cDNA of the grass carp XCR1 gene is
                 1659 bp and encodes 365 amino acids. XCR1 contains
                 seven conserved transmembrane helical domains. The
                 homologous tertiary structure of XCR1 is similar to its
                 homologs in other species. After artificial GCRV
                 infection, there were significant differences in the
                 expression of the grass carp XCR1 gene in different
                 tissues, at different time points, and between P1 and
                 F1 fish. These results will contribute to our
                 understanding of the role of XCR1 in fish immune
                 responses and contribute to the development of
                 GCRV-resistant grass carp.",

                 flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) have sex-biased
                 expression patterns, but their target genes and how
                 they work in the development of the gonads are rarely
                 known. Anti-M{\"u}llerian hormone (AMH) can inhibit the
                 development of Muller's duct in female mammals and
                 regulate the formation of gametes after sexual
                 maturity. There is no Muller's duct in teleosts, but
                 the amh gene still exists. Knockout of amh results in
                 sex reversal from male to female. Therefore, it is
                 essential to explore the relationship between the
                 miR-200 family and amh to clarify what role miR-200
                 plays in the development of the gonads. In Japanese
                 flounder, the two binding sites for the miR-200 family
                 in the 3{\prime}UTR of amh were found through
                 bioinformatic prediction. Double luciferase and green
                 fluorescent protein reporter experiments demonstrated
                 amh to be directly targeted by miR-200a and miR-200b.
                 Moreover, miR-200a and miR-200b reduced the expression
                 of amh through site 1 rather than site 2. To explore
                 the regulatory role of miR-200a in gonadal development,
                 we further overexpressed miR-200a in the primary
                 Sertoli cells of the testis. With the overexpression of
                 miR-200a, the expression of amh decreased, while the
                 expression of the other two male sex-related genes,
                 dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor
                 1) and gsdf (diagonal soma driven factor), increased
                 significantly. This result indicates that the miR-200
                 family regulates the gonadal differentiation and

                 The expression of zo-2 was higher with the 6 g kg

                 by Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp AHPND) has been reported
                 in commodity shrimp, but the potential risk of its
                 global spread via frozen shrimp in the shrimp trade is
                 yet to be fully explored. We hypothesized that frozen
                 shrimp with AHPND could be a source of Vp AHPND
                 transmission; thus, the infectivity of frozen shrimp
                 with AHPND was evaluated using a shrimp bioassay. To
                 prepare infected frozen shrimp, 12 Penaeus vannamei
                 (average weight, 2 g) were exposed to Vp AHPND by
                 immersion in water with a Vp AHPND concentration of
                 1.55 $ \times $ 10 7 CFU mL {$-$1}; once dead, the
                 shrimp were stored at {$-$80} {$^\circ $}C for further
                 analysis. After two weeks, a PCR assay was used to
                 confirm AHPND positivity in frozen shrimp (n = 2), and
                 Vp AHPND was reisolated from the hepatopancreases of
                 these shrimp. For the infectivity test, 10 P. vannamei
                 (average weight, 4 g) were fed with the
                 hepatopancreases of Vp AHPND -infected frozen shrimp (n
                 = 10). After feeding, 70\% of the shrimp died within
                 118 h, and the presence of Vp AHPND was confirmed using
                 a PCR assay and histopathology examination; moreover,
                 Vp AHPND was successfully reisolated from the
                 hepatopancreases of the dead shrimp. We are the first
                 to evaluate the potential transmissibility of Vp AHPND
                 in frozen shrimp, and our results suggest that frozen

  abstract =     "The Beibu Gulf in the northwestern South China Sea is
                 one of the world's most productive fishing grounds, yet
                 its biotic resources appear to be in rapid decline
                 because of overexploitation. Assessments of the health
                 status of the fisheries' resources in the gulf provide
                 a foundation for their conservation and management. As
                 fish accounted for 84\% to 97\% of the total catch in
                 the Beibu Gulf in the period 1962--2017, a Fish-based
                 Index of Biotic Integrity (F-IBI) was developed for the
                 Beibu Gulf, and data from otter trawl surveys during
                 the period 1962--2017 were used to measure variations
                 in the fish community. The assessment revealed a
                 generally downward trend in total fish catch density
                 (kg/km 2), catch density of 12 traditional commercial
                 demersal fish species, and percentage of
                 nektonic-feeding species, but an upward trend for the
                 percentage of fishes with a planktivorous or detritus
                 diet, percentage of pelagic species, and percentage of
                 the dominant species. The dominant species varied
                 greatly over the 50 year period and showed a tendency
                 towards small-sized species. The synthetic F-IBI
                 variable showed a downward trend and has indicated a
                 `fair' state since 1998. The decline in the F-IBI over
                 the last three decades suggests that anthropogenic
                 disturbances, especially overfishing, have had a
                 serious impact on the fish community of the Beibu Gulf.
                 The F-IBI is currently at risk of becoming `poor.'
                 Consequently, we suggest that rigid and enforceable
                 fishery management measures should be taken by both
                 China and Vietnam to prevent further deterioration of
                 the fisheries' resources in the gulf.",

  abstract =     "The WAC Bennett Dam was completed in 1968 and
                 impounded the Upper Peace River to form the Williston
                 Reservoir in north central British Columbia. In 1990,
                 an enhancement project was initiated to stock Columbia
                 River Kokanee (non-anadromous Sockeye Salmon;
                 Oncorhynchus nerka) from southeastern British Columbia
                 into tributary streams that drained into regions of the
                 reservoir that were accessible by anglers. The current
                 distribution of spawning Columbia-origin Kokanee in the
                 Williston Reservoir watershed, however, does not
                 reflect the locations where these fish were initially
                 stocked and suggests extensive straying. Whether or not
                 Kokanee will develop fidelity to specific spawning
                 locations is not known, but it is important information
                 to effectively manage these introduced fish. We used
                 otolith microchemistry to estimate fidelity to natal
                 streams by Columbia-origin Kokanee in the Williston
                 Reservoir. Otolith elemental signatures for the region
                 of the otolith that formed during the larval period and
                 characterized the natal redd environment showed
                 considerable variation among samples. Natal signatures
                 tended to cluster for each river but not for all
                 spawners, suggesting elemental signatures from other
                 rivers. Homing to one of the four natal streams we
                 examined was classified to be 73\% based on linear
                 discriminant analysis, although variation in the
                 elemental signatures within each group suggests that
                 homing by Kokanee to specific natal streams may be as
                 low as 55\%. Based on similarity of water elemental
                 signatures for tributaries within large rivers,
                 however, the proportion of fish that returned to their
                 general region was likely higher and estimated to be
                 approximately 83\%. The result of regional homing could
                 be reproductive isolation and adaptation to local
                 conditions. It is unclear, however, if the current
                 estimated level of straying will limit genetic
                 differentiation and prevent local adaptation.",

                 thousands of otolith or scale images to determine the
                 age structure of commercial fish stocks. This knowledge
                 is important for fisheries and conservation management.
                 However, the age-reading procedure is time-consuming
                 and costly to perform due to the specialized expertise
                 and labor needed to identify annual growth zones in
                 otoliths. Effective automated systems are needed to
                 increase throughput and reduce cost. DeepOtolith is an
                 open-source artificial intelligence (AI) platform that
                 addresses this issue by providing a web system with a
                 simple interface that automatically estimates fish age
                 by combining otolith images with convolutional neural
                 networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks that
                 has been a dominant method in computer vision tasks.
                 Users can upload otolith image data for selective fish
                 species, and the platform returns age estimates. The
                 estimates of multiple images can be exported to conduct
                 conclusions or further age-related research.
                 DeepOtolith currently contains classifiers/regressors
                 for three fish species; however, more species will be
                 included as related work on ageing will be tested and
                 published soon. Herein, the architecture and
                 functionality of the platform are presented. Current
                 limitations and future directions are also discussed.
                 Overall, DeepOtolith should be considered as the first
                 step towards building a community of marine ecologists,
                 machine learning experts, and stakeholders that will
                 collaborate to support the conservation of fishery

                 entrance of Salerno gulf, showed a basic intersexuality
                 characterized by the presence of male secondary and
                 female primary sexual characters. The reproductive
                 system has been described with an accurate
                 morphological analysis, also including a histological
                 assessment of oocytes. Results showed the presence of

                 length, with the absence of internal males' sexual
                 organs. Concerning the female primary characters, the
                 analysis of histological assessment showed the
                 structure of mature oocyte, confirming the maturity

                 intend to study the functional characterization and
                 molecular marker development of the penk gene related
                 to food habit domestication of mandarin fish. We found
                 that the penk gene of mandarin fish had three types of
                 endogenous opioid peptide sequences. Compared with
                 other tissues, penk mRNA was highly expressed in the
                 whole brain. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of
                 lysine or methionine significantly increased the
                 expression of penk mRNA. The expression of penk mRNA in
                 the brain of mandarin fish that could be easily
                 domesticated from eating live prey fish to artificial
                 diets was significantly higher than those that could
                 not. After feeding with high-carbohydrate artificial
                 diets, the expression of penk mRNA showed no
                 significant difference between mandarin fish with
                 hypophagia and those that still ate normally. A total
                 of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) loci
                 related to easy domestication toward eating artificial
                 diets were screened from the mandarin fish population.
                 Additionally, the TT genotype at one of the loci was
                 significantly correlated with the food habit
                 domestication of mandarin fish.",

                 the ability of fisheries to withstand these changes and
                 impacts are major challenges in regard to addressing
                 future climate hazards in Taiwan. Taiwan's geographic
                 location is favourable for the marine fishery industry,
                 which is an important primary industry and a source of
                 animal protein for residents of Taiwan. Recently, both
                 long-term climate change and extreme climate hazards
                 have led to shocks in the marine fishery industry. The
                 resulting instability of the industry directly affects
                 the market supply of and demand for seafood. We conduct
                 a case study of a marine fishery industry in Taiwan

  abstract =     "Early development, when many important developmental
                 events occur, is a critical period for fish. However,
                 research on the early development of clearhead icefish
                 is very limited, especially in molecular research. In
                 this study, we aimed to explore the dynamic changes in
                 the biological functions of five key periods in
                 clearhead icefish early development, namely the YL
                 (embryonic), PM (first day after hatching), KK (fourth
                 day after hatching), LC (seventh day after hatching),
                 and SL (tenth day after hatching) stages, through
                 transcriptome sequencing and different analysis
                 strategies. A trend expression analysis and an
                 enrichment analysis revealed that the expression
                 ofgenes encoding G protein-coupled receptors and their
                 ligands, i.e., prss1\_2\_3, pomc, npy, npb, sst, rln3,
                 crh, gh, and prl that are associated with digestion and
                 feeding regulation gradually increased during early
                 development. In addition, a weighted gene co-expression
                 network analysis (WGCNA) showed that eleven modules
                 were significantly associated with early development,
                 among which nine modules were significantly positively
                 correlated. Through the enrichment analysis and hub
                 gene identification results of these nine modules, it
                 was found that the pathways related to eye, bone, and
                 heart development were significantly enriched in the YL
                 stage, and the ccnd2, seh1l, kdm6a, arf4, and ankrd28
                 genes that are associated with cell proliferation and
                 differentiation played important roles in these
                 developmental processes; the pak3, dlx3, dgat2, and
                 tas1r1 genes that are associated with jaw and tooth
                 development, TG (triacylglycerol) synthesis, and umami
                 amino acid receptors were identified as hub genes for
                 the PM stage; the pathways associated with aerobic
                 metabolism and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis were
                 significantly enriched in the KK stage, with the foxk,
                 slc13a2\_3\_5, ndufa5, and lsc2 genes playing important
                 roles; the pathways related to visual perception were
                 significantly enriched in the LC stage; and the bile
                 acid biosynthetic and serine-type peptidase activity
                 pathways were significantly enriched in the SL stage.
                 These results provide a more detailed understanding of

  abstract =     "Although the GDP of the fishery sector accounts for
                 less than 0.3\% of Taiwan's GDP, there are many
                 secondary and tertiary industries related to fisheries
                 that add great value to the country's economy.
                 Therefore, when analyzing and calculating the output
                 value and value added of the fishery sector, the
                 relevance of these upstream and downstream industries
                 should be considered jointly, and the value chain of
                 the fishery industry should be studied and analyzed in
                 order to truly present the value added created by
                 fishery. This study aims to do this by first analyzing
                 not only the primary fishery industry, but the value
                 chain of the fishery industry at different stages such
                 as fishery production, marine fishing, aquaculture,
                 fishery processing, retail and services, and supportive
                 systems. Then the value added of the whole fishery
                 value chain to Taiwan's GDP is estimated by using the
                 Leontief input--output model, from the perspective of
                 industry linkages and covering the period from 2011 to
                 2018. The empirical results suggest that the value
                 added created by fishery and related industries
                 accounted for 2.96\% of the GDP in 2011, which rose to
                 3.11\% in 2014, fell to 2.87\% in 2015, rose to 2.93\%
                 in 2017, and fell to 2.84\% in 2018. From 2011 to 2018,
                 the amount of value added created by fisheries and
                 related industries rose from NT$ 422.8 b i l l i o n t
                 o N T $ 520.9 billion. The primary fishery sector has
                 the largest contribution, followed by the fishery input
                 sector, and transportation and sale service sector, and
                 the fishery product processing sector has the lowest
                 contribution rate. The empirical results provide

                 investigated for the extraction and production of a
                 vast array of active molecules. The aim of this study
                 was to produce phenazine compounds from FBPs via
                 microbial fermentation and assess their novel
                 antinematode effect. Among various FBPs, squid pen
                 powder (SPP) was discovered as the most suitable
                 substrate for phenazine production by Pseudomonas
                 aeruginosa TUN03 fermentation. Various small-scale
                 experiments conducted in flasks for phenazine
                 production indicated that the most suitable was the
                 newly designed liquid medium which included 1\% SPP,
                 0.05\% MgSO 4, and 0.1\% Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 (initial pH 7).
                 Phenazines were further studied for scale-up
                 bioproduction in a 14 L bioreactor system resulting in
                 a high yield (22.73 {\SGMLmicro}g/mL) in a much shorter
                 cultivation time (12 h). In the fermented culture
                 broth, hemi-pyocyanin (HPC) was detected as a major
                 phenazine compound with an area percentage of 11.28\%
                 in the crude sample. In the bioactivity tests, crude
                 phenazines and HPC demonstrate novel potential
                 nematicidal activity against black pepper nematodes,
                 inhibiting both juveniles (J2) nematodes and egg
                 hatching. The results of this work suggest a novel use
                 of SPP for cost-effective bioproduction of HPC, a novel
                 potential nematodes inhibitor. Moreover, the
                 combination of MgSO 4 and Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 was also found
                 to be a novel salt composition that significantly

                 of marking such fish is challenging. We exposed
                 juvenile crucian carp (Carassius carassius) to a single
                 concentration of SrCl 2 {\cdot}6H 2 O for 5 d and
                 evaluated the efficiency of Sr marking of the fish
                 otoliths (sagittae, asterisci, and lapilli) using an
                 electron probe micro-analyzer. Sr marking signatures
                 formed a peak in all otolith types, with a marking
                 success rate of 100\%. The ratio of Sr to Ca in the
                 lapilli and sagittae was higher than that in the
                 asterisci. It took 2 d from the beginning of immersion
                 to the deposition of Sr on the lapilli and sagittae,
                 and the time delay for asterisci was 1 d. For the
                 lapilli and sagittae, it took 16 d to terminate Sr
                 marking and fully recover to the pre-marking Sr level,
                 whereas it was 12 d for the asterisci. The application
                 of the Sr dose had no effect on the survival or growth
                 of the carp. This study demonstrated that the lapilli
                 are the most suitable otolith type for Sr marking
                 observations in crucian carp and provides a theoretical
                 basis and technical support for carp restocking using
                 the Sr marking approach.",

                 pathogen in intensive Nile tilapia production, causing
                 high mortality rates and great economic losses. This
                 work aimed to evaluate the Nile tilapia vaccination
                 against S. agalactiae and fed with ration containing
                 probiotic AQUA PHOTO {\reg} composed of Bacillus
                 subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum, on the immune
                 response action and gut microbiota. The experimental
                 design was completely randomized with five treatments
                 (CON = control; ADJ = adjuvant; PRO = probiotic; VAC =
                 vaccine; PRO + VAC = probiotic + vaccine) and five
                 replicates. The vaccine (bacterin + adjuvant) was
                 injected after 21 days (21d) of probiotic feeding and
                 the vaccine was booster 14 days post-vaccination (35d).
                 After 14 days of the booster (49d), the fish were
                 challenged with S. agalactiae and observed for more
                 than 14 days, completing 63 days. The immunized group
                 showed a better survival rate (CON 40\%; ADJ 57\%; PRO
                 67\%; VAC 87\%; PRO + VAC 97\%). The treatments VAC and
                 PRO + VAC, after booster produced higher levels of IgM
                 antibodies compared with the control from the same
                 time. The combination of probiotic and vaccination
                 provided better protection against S. agalactiae
                 infection, directly affecting the gut microbiological
                 profile. These results indicated the contribution of
                 probiotic to the adaptive immune response through the
                 modulation of the intestinal microbiota, improving the
                 effect of the vaccination. In conclusion, AQUA PHOTO
                 {\reg}, composed of B. subtilis and L. plantarum,
                 orally administered to Nile tilapia vaccinated against
                 and challenged with S. agalactiae increases protection
                 from infection and modifies the intestinal microbiota
                 profile of the host, promoting the microbiota balance

                 community in the Adriatic Sea, but knowledge about its
                 feeding ecology is scarce. The aim of this paper is to
                 present new evidence about its food preferences and
                 feeding habits. An innovative non-destructive method of
                 fecal pellet analysis was used for this study. This
                 method does not require sacrificing specimens and the
                 fish can be released back into the sea alive after the
                 laboratory work. The results demonstrated that S.
                 scriba mainly preys on decapods, followed by
                 polychaetes, isopods, fish, mollusks and swarming
                 shrimps. The calculated index of trophic diversity
                 (ITD) value of 0.89 indicates that it is an
                 opportunistic feeder that feeds on a wide range of
                 different prey. According to the calculated trophic
                 level of 3.43, which is higher than that of other
                 members of the community, S. scriba is also an
                 important piscivorous predator. With age, S. scriba
                 undergoes an ontogenetic shift. The proportion of
                 crustaceans, gastropods and polychaetes decreases with
                 age and body size, while the proportion of fish

                 spawning with three spawning peaks. The daily growth
                 analysis was performed in otoliths of adult females on
                 the transversal section of the sagittae otolith. Daily
                 increments were measured from the border to the nucleus
                 in females until they were discernible. Results show
                 that daily growth of females decreases during the
                 spawning period because they allocate less energy to
                 somatic growth in favor of the production of gametes,
                 with an increase in growth in July. Lastly, daily
                 growth individual trends showed a ``spawning pattern''
                 in 28\% of medium and large females, suggesting an
                 individual spawning period of one to two months, with
                 4--5 valleys of narrow daily increments, likely
                 associated to batch release: individual spawning
                 frequency would be 4--5 days. This is the first time
                 that individual spawning frequency in hake is estimated
                 based on individual data. Finally, the spawning pattern
                 is detected only once per year, indicating that a
                 single female participates only in one spawning peak
                 per year, supporting the hypothesis of the existence of

                 solution to integrate PV power and E. sinensis
                 culturing. In this study, we cultured E. sinensis in an
                 area of PV panels (PV group) and an area with no PV
                 panels (control group), respectively. The results

                 The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
                 (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and aspartate aminotransferase
                 (AST) in each concentration group generally showed a
                 trend of a first increasing and then decreasing during
                 the 96-h stress process ($ p < 0.05$)1, while no
                 significant changes were observed in the blank group
                 during this period ($ p > 0.05$). The activities of
                 CAT, GSH and AST in all treatment reached peak values
                 at 24--48 h. At 96 h of alkalinity stress, the

                 phosphatise (ACP) and alkaline phosphatise (AKP) in the
                 18.25 mmol/L group were not significantly different
                 with the control group ($ p < 0.05$). The activities of
                 SOD and CAT in the 52.53 and 69.74 mmol/L treatment
                 were significantly lower than those in the control
                 group ($ p < 0.05$), and the level of total antioxidant
                 capacity(T-AOC), ALT, ACP and AKP in the 69.74 mmol/L
                 group were significantly higher than those in the other
                 groups ($ p < 0.05$). Hepatopancreatic histological
                 observation showed that the hepatopancreas of E.
                 sinensis in the control group was normal. With
                 increasing alkalinity, the basal membrane of the
                 hepatopancreas fell off or even ruptured. Additionally,
                 the number of hepatopancreas vacuoles increased, the
                 volume of B cells and their internal transport vesicles
                 increased, epithelial cells disintegrated, and the
                 nucleus gradually shrank. E. sinensis can activate
                 antioxidant and nonspecific immune systems to adapt to
                 alkalinity stress. However, oxidative stress, immune
                 system damage and hepatopancreas structure damage were
                 caused when the stress exceeded the adaptive capacity
                 of the body.",

  abstract =     "Globally, over 85\% of oyster reefs have been lost,
                 and the combined effects of climate change, ocean
                 acidification, and environmental degradation, including
                 pollution and mangrove overharvesting, could further
                 reduce global oyster fisheries in the coming decades.
                 To understand the level of impact of climate change on
                 the oyster fishery in West Africa, an expert-based
                 vulnerability assessment to climate change was
                 conducted for the West African mangrove oyster
                 (Crassostrea tulipa, Lamarck 1819). Using a combination
                 of the exposure of the oyster to climatic stressors
                 (estuarine temperature, salinity, river flow, surface
                 run-off, sea level rise, and estuarine circulation)
                 together with an assessment of sensitivity to these
                 stressors, we estimate the overall vulnerability of C.
                 tulipa to climate change. A very high overall climate
                 vulnerability score of 12 on a scale of 16 was
                 calculated for C. tulipa. While the overall climate
                 exposure score in the West African coastal region
                 remained high, the high sensitivity of C. tulipa to
                 hydrographic conditions of its habitat, in particular
                 salinity, coupled with its sessile and habitat-specific
                 nature, pushed the overall vulnerability to very high.
                 Early life history settlement requirements, adult
                 mobility, and sensitivity to salinity were the three
                 most important biological and sensitivity attributes
                 that determined the vulnerability score. By leaving
                 each of these three sensitivity attributes out of the
                 analysis, the overall vulnerability score was reduced
                 to 9 (i.e., from very high to high). A negative
                 directional effect of climate change, coupled with a
                 low potential for change in distribution, threatens the
                 C. tulipa fishery in a long-term adverse climate
                 scenario. We recommend management efforts that
                 incorporate climate resilience and adaptation practices
                 to prioritize recruitment success, as well as the
                 development of breeding lines with climate-resilient
                 traits.",

                 at different time scales (daily, weekly, monthly,

                 interactions and predicting the spatial distribution of
                 its schools can improve conservation actions and
                 fishery management, along with the operation of the
                 fleets targeting E. ringens. There is an important
                 fishery of E. ringens in Northern Chile ({18$^\circ

                 identify and predict potential fishing grounds for E.
                 ringens in this system, we implemented a predictive
                 model of fishing grounds based on neural networks,
                 which was trained with the georeferenced data of daily
                 catches by industrial purse sein ships from 2003 to

                 Copernicus Marine Enviroment Monitoring Service (CMEMS
                 program). The neural network model had a very good
                 performance (86\%). Longitude (23\%) was the most
                 relevant variable for identifying potential fishing
                 grounds, followed by the mixed layer depth (18\%),
                 latitude (15\%), sea surface temperature (12\%), month
                 (12\%), sea height (9\%), salinity (9\%), and the zonal
                 and meridional components of the current velocity

                 33.68\%, 36.18\%, and 38.75\% dry matter). The results
                 showed that 26.45\% dietary protein significantly
                 improved glycolysis by increasing PK mRNA levels, while
                 the 29.28\% and 31.69\% dietary protein levels promoted
                 gluconeogenesis by increasing PEPCK and G6Pase mRNA
                 levels. For lipid metabolism, 26.45\% dietary protein

                 SREBP1c, and FAS mRNA levels, while 31.69\% dietary
                 protein enhanced the level of lipolysis by increasing

                 terms of antioxidants and immunity, the 31.69\% dietary
                 protein level activated the expression levels of HSP90
                 mRNA, thus increasing the expression levels of
                 antioxidant-related genes (CAT, SOD, and GPx), and
                 upregulating the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 mRNA

                 behavior and reduce the loss caused by stress and other
                 circumstances. Conventional techniques are
                 time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to
                 accidents. Deep learning (DL) technology is rapidly
                 gaining popularity in various fields, including
                 aquaculture. Moving towards smart fish farming
                 necessitates the precise and accurate identification of
                 fish biodiversity. Observing fish behavior in real time
                 is imperative to make better feeding decisions. The
                 proposed study consists of an efficient end-to-end
                 convolutional neural network (CNN) classifying fish
                 behavior into the normal and starvation categories. The
                 performance of the CNN is evaluated by varying the
                 number of fully connected (FC) layers with or without
                 applying max-pooling operation. The accuracy of the
                 detection algorithm is increased by 10\% by
                 incorporating three FC layers and max pooling
                 operation. The results demonstrated that the shallow
                 architecture of the CNN model, which employs a
                 max-pooling function with more FC layers, exhibits
                 promising performance and achieves 98\% accuracy. The
                 presented system is a novel step in laying the
                 foundation for an automated behavior identification
                 system in modern fish farming.",

  abstract =     "Cimei Island is a second-class outlying island. In
                 recent years, due to the lack of coastal fishery
                 resources and restrictions on traffic and climate, the
                 traditional fishery and tourism industries that
                 residents rely on for a living have faced challenges.
                 This research is based on the Barbados Programme of
                 Action, from the perspective of environmental
                 conservation, industrial economy, and social
                 development in sustainable development, and from the
                 perspective of local stakeholders, to construct a
                 sustainable tourism action approach and development
                 mechanism in Cimei Island. A qualitative research
                 method was adopted. Various sources of data, including
                 focus discussions and in-depth interviews with local
                 stakeholders, textual materials, and field
                 observations, were collected and analyzed. The results
                 are as follows: (1) Cimei faces great threats in
                 social, economic, and environmental aspects, which has
                 led to Cimei Islands' promotion of permanent
                 development. (2) The current development of Cimei
                 cannot effectively drive industrial development or the
                 transformation of fishing villages. However, residents
                 are worried that overdevelopment will impact the
                 ecological environment and lifestyle on the Islands.
                 (3) Cimei's sustainable tourism development approach
                 should be to first take inventory of the ecological
                 environment and cultural resources, plan related
                 environmental laws and regulations, and finally, use
                 sustainable tourism to drive industrial development to
                 carry out island development.",

                 fish are affected by foreign substances. Therefore,
                 fish need a certain adaptation period to eliminate the
                 stress response. Herein, in order to determine the
                 adaptation period, the bionic robot fish was used to
                 obtain behavioral information about crucian carp, which
                 was tested at five time points (1st, 7th, 14th, 21st
                 and 28th day) within 28 days. First, the fear response
                 and exploratory behavior of crucian carp affected by
                 three-color bionic robot fish were explored. Then,
                 according to the measurement results of the behavior,
                 morphology, and feeding, and the physiological and
                 biochemical properties of the crucian carp, a
                 multi-parameter evaluation method was proposed to
                 determine the adaptation period of the crucian carp
                 under this monitoring mode. The results showed that
                 more than 4 areas were occupied by crucian carp from
                 the 21st day. From the 16th day, the number of crucian
                 carp swimming with clear outlines gradually increased.
                 The number of abnormal swimming occurrences decreased
                 on day 13. More than 80\% of the crucian carp body
                 color returned to dark on the 23rd day. The crucian
                 carp did not respond to food until day 19, when most of
                 the crucian carp began to scramble for food. Food
                 consumption reached more than two thirds on day 22. In
                 addition, glucose and total protein leveled off after
                 day 21, when mean hemoglobin levels were highest.
                 Triglycerides showed a trend of first decreasing and
                 then increasing. The pigmented area of the skin section
                 gradually decreases and eventually stabilizes. In
                 summary, it takes at least 23 days for the crucian carp
                 to adapt to the influence of the bionic robot fish.",

  abstract =     "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are becoming one of the most
                 important model organisms in behavioural neuroscience.
                 It has been shown repeatedly that different zebrafish
                 strains show large behavioural differences. These
                 divergent behavioural profiles may have a genetic
                 basis, but environmental factors and previous
                 experience are also known to greatly affect the
                 behavioural phenotype of zebrafish. It could be
                 expected that behavioural differences at the larval
                 stage should be less affected by environmental factors
                 and experience. In the present study, we screened
                 larvae of zebrafish of the AB strain and offspring of
                 wild-caught zebrafish for boldness, using an open field
                 test. In order to follow the behavioural development,
                 we studied larvae at the age of 5-, 7-, 12- and 30-days
                 post fertilization (dpf). Behaviour, as well as
                 behavioural development, clearly differed between the
                 larvae of the different strains. Wild larvae showed
                 larger total distance moved than AB larvae, both at
                 light and dark conditions. These differences were
                 already present at 12 dpf but became more pronounced
                 with age. Wild larvae had a greater variance compared
                 to AB larvae for most of the variables. We have
                 previously shown that bold and shy adult zebrafish
                 differ in the brain expression of dopamine and opioid
                 receptors. The results of the current study show that
                 wild larvae display significantly higher brain
                 expression of drd2b than AB larvae at 30 dpf, a
                 difference that could be related to differences in
                 activity. We did not detect any differences in the
                 expression of opioid receptors.",

                 catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate,
                 which plays a role in the promotion of muscle cell
                 growth and in improving the flavor of meats. In this
                 study, a GS gene encoding 371 amino acids was cloned
                 from triploid crucian carp and showed the highest level
                 of similarity with the GS gene found in Cyprinus
                 carpio. Meanwhile, GS was differentially expressed in
                 different tissues, and its day--night expression
                 changes showed obvious oscillation. Additionally, the
                 effects of glutamate and glutamine on GS expression in
                 muscle cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo. We
                 found that its expression was obviously increased due
                 to high levels of glutamate (2 mg/mL) but decreased by
                 glutamine in vitro. However, it was significantly
                 promoted by glutamate and glutamine in vivo, with an
                 optimal concentration of 2\%. Furthermore, the use of
                 lysine--glutamate dipeptides as feed additives also had
                 a positive influence on GS expression (the optimal
                 concentration is 0.8\%). Finally, we explored the
                 effects of different protein levels and sources on the
                 expression of GS, and the results demonstrated that GS
                 had the highest expression at the 35\% protein level,
                 but no significant differences were observed in the
                 different protein sources between the fish meal diet
                 (FM) and the mixed diet comprising soybean meal and
                 rapeseed meal (SM). This study sheds new light on the

  abstract =     "Climate change is a growing threat to marine organisms
                 and ecosystems, and it is already modifying ocean
                 properties by, for example, increasing temperature and
                 decreasing pH. Increasing water temperature may also
                 lead to an impairment of primary productivity and an
                 overall depletion of available zooplankton.
                 Understanding how the crossover between warming and
                 zooplankton availability impacts fish populations has
                 paramount implications for conservation and mitigation
                 strategies. Through a cross factorial design to test
                 the effects of ocean temperature and food availability
                 in a temperate marine teleost, Pomatochistus
                 flavescens, we showed that hindered feeding impacted
                 sheltering and avoidance behaviour. Also, low food
                 availability impaired fish reproduction, particularly
                 male reproduction, as the expression of cyp11b1, a gene
                 with a pivotal role in the synthesis of the most
                 important fish androgen, 11-ketotestosterone, was
                 significantly reduced under a low food regime. In
                 contrast, temperature alone did not affect reproductive
                 success, but offspring showed increased saturated fatty
                 acid content (embryos) and increased lipid peroxidation
                 (larvae). Altogether, food availability had a stronger
                 effect on fitness, showing that coping with elevated
                 temperatures, an ability that may be expected in
                 shallow-water fish, can be indirectly impacted, or even
                 overwhelmed, by the effects of ocean warming on primary
                 productivity and downstream ecological processes.",

  abstract =     "Fish population fluctuations have been widely
                 documented and are often attributed to climate
                 variability, but little is known about their
                 relationship. This is a barrier that restricts our
                 capacity to understand climate effects on fish
                 fluctuations. Here, we collected published data to
                 conduct a comparative analysis of time series in terms
                 of both scale deposition rate (SDR) and catch to
                 indicate the abundance of anchovy and explored its
                 relationships with climatic and environmental
                 parameters. We first conducted a Spearman correlation
                 analysis to identify the differences in the SDR between
                 sites. Then, we used Generalized Additive Models to
                 evaluate the effects of external forcing at multiple
                 spatial scales (i.e., local and global scales) on the
                 anchovy catches recorded at the California Current
                 Ecosystem (CCE), Humboldt Current Ecosystem (HCE), and
                 Kuroshio Current Ecosystem (KCE). We found that the
                 SDRs at different sites in the same Current Systems are
                 generally consistent, while there are more differences
                 between different systems. We also found that the
                 Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDOI), North Pacific
                 index (NPI), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index
                 (NPGOI), Sea Surface Temperature anomaly (SSTA), and
                 Air Temperature anomaly (ATA) were the most influential
                 factors explaining the variability in anchovy catch for
                 CCE, whereas the NPGOI was the most influential factor
                 for HCE. The PDOI was the best at explaining the
                 variability in anchovy catch for KCE. Our results
                 suggest that anchovy fluctuations in the Pan-Pacific
                 occurred synchronously. These seemingly unrelated
                 events, which occurred thousands of kilometers apart,
                 were actually not isolated. Therefore, we suggest that
                 large-scale climate forcing may activate synchronous
                 fluctuations for anchovy populations at the basin
                 scale, whereas local-scale environmental forces are
                 also responsible for anchovy fluctuations in the
                 ``micro-environment''.",

                 maturities were collected from South China Sea in
                 spring 2020. Results showed that Mycoplasma was the
                 most dominant group of bacteria in the intestinal
                 samples of the females with immature gonads (FN),
                 females at sexual maturity (FY), and males at sexual

                 community structure in squid gills differed from that
                 of intestinal flora. The BD1-7 clade was the dominant

  abstract =     "Fish represent an excellent source of animal protein
                 as well as a biomedical research model as a result of
                 their evolutionary relatedness and similarity with the
                 human genome. Commercial and ornamental fish culture
                 has achieved popularity, but reproductive dysfunctions
                 act as a limiting factor for quality fry production,
                 interfering with the sustainability of the aquaculture
                 industry. Fish reproduction is crucial for any species'
                 existence, and reproductive performance can potentially
                 be improved through applications of epigenetics and
                 probiotics. Epigenetics is a highly sensitive molecular
                 approach that includes chromatin structure and function
                 alteration, DNA methylation, and modification of
                 non-coding RNA molecules for the transfer of desired
                 information from parents to offspring. DNA
                 methyltransferase improves reproductive cyp11a1, esr2b,
                 and figla gene expression and feminizes zebrafish
                 (Danio rerio). Moreover, epigenetics also contributes
                 to genome stability, environmental plasticity, and
                 embryonic development. However, methylation of specific
                 genes can negatively affect sperm quality, resulting in
                 poor fertilization. Probiotic administration is able to
                 induce responsiveness of incompetent follicles to
                 maturation-inducing hormones and can change oocyte
                 chemical composition during vitellogenic development.
                 The positive role of probiotics on testicular cells is
                 validated by upregulating the transcription levels of
                 leptin, bdnf, and dmrt1 genes facilitating the
                 spermatogenesis. This review not only discusses the
                 effects and mechanism of epigenetics and probiotics for
                 improving fish reproduction, but also presents an
                 overview of the causal factors and current techniques
                 used to eradicate dysfunction. Moreover, key genes and
                 hormones related to fish reproduction along with
                 research gaps and future prospects are also considered.

                 information for students, scientists, researchers, and

                 an upper beak microstructure to estimate the age of
                 purpleback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis).
                 From these microstructures, the age and growth of squid
                 caught from January to March and May to August in 2018,
                 2019, and 2020 in the waters surrounding the Xisha
                 Islands in the South China Sea were determined. We
                 found three typical growth zones (the hood region,
                 crest region, and axis), abnormal increments (checks),
                 and erosion in the beak examination. The average dorsal
                 mantle length (ML) of males and females was 112.13
                 ({\pm}15.23 mm) and 119.67 mm ({\pm}24.50 mm),
                 respectively, and no squid were older than 10 months.
                 The peak hatching dates, according to back
                 calculations, were from October to January of the next
                 year. All sampled squid belonged to the autumn/winter
                 cohort. Significant sex differences were found in the
                 relationship between ML and age in squid with similar
                 growth patterns. Exponential models best described the
                 relationships of ML with age and body weight (BW) for
                 both sexes. However, a linear model best described the
                 relationship between age and upper rostrum length
                 (URL). The maximum absolute daily growth rates (AGR) of
                 BW were reached during days 240--270 for both sexes.
                 The maximum AGRs in ML were reached during days
                 180--210 and 240--270 for males and females,
                 respectively. The period of 120--150 days (4--5 months)
                 was considered the sub-adult stage of S. oualaniensis

                 significant role in boosting the trade gains of both
                 developed and developing seafood-exporting countries
                 over the past three decades. In addition, the extent of
                 GVC participation has become the most important
                 platform for addressing gains from trade in developing
                 seafood-exporting countries to ensure that their
                 participation enhances economic growth. Recent studies
                 on GVC participation in developing countries have
                 highlighted the importance of domestic institutions.
                 However, the literature is silent on the quality of the
                 domestic institutions--GVC participation nexus. This
                 paper aims to investigate the determinants of GVC
                 participation and the effect of the quality of domestic
                 institutional governance on seafood-exporting
                 developing countries' GVC participation indices. Using
                 the Hausman--Taylor (HT) estimator and the system

                 methodology to examine seafood export data from 32
                 countries from 2009 to 2018, we find that economic
                 potential drives backward GVC participation, while low
                 forward participation might not only lead to lower
                 gains from trade, but also limit countries to the
                 supply of primary seafood products with little value
                 addition. In addition, the quality of domestic
                 institutional governance constrains GVC participation.
                 Overall the results indicate that the quality of
                 domestic institutional governance matters for the GVC
                 participation of seafood-exporting developing
                 countries.",

                 hepatopancreas and muscle fatty acid (FA) composition,
                 expression of lipid-relevant genes, and blood
                 parameters were evaluated. Four isoproteic and
                 isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to
                 contain 44\% crude protein and 11\% lipids with graded
                 inclusion levels of ARA, 0\% (Control), 0.4, 0.9, and
                 1.4\% of the total diet. S. dorsalis juveniles (14.54
                 {\pm} 0.18 g) were randomly divided into twelve tanks
                 with fifteen animals each. The animals were hand fed
                 three times per day to apparent satiation. Dietary
                 treatments did not significantly affect the growth
                 performance, SGR, FCR, and feed intake of fish.
                 Different levels of ARA in the experimental diets
                 directly influenced liver and muscle FA profiles, with
                 significant changes in ARA and EPA deposition between
                 Control treatment and 1.4\%, in both tissues. The
                 expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (alox5),
                 acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (acadvl),
                 carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1(cpt1a) was
                 significantly affected by dietary treatments, with an
                 expression increasing accordingly to the increasing ARA
                 levels. In contrast, a reduction of fatty acid synthase
                 (fas) and proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppara)
                 expression was significantly reduced as ARA increased
                 in the diet. In addition, a significant reduction in
                 blood cortisol and glucose was found at a 0.9\% ARA
                 level compared to the other treatments. Based on the

                 the most heavily exploited sharks, being the main
                 by-catch species in both tuna longline and purse-seine
                 fisheries in tropical waters worldwide. Despite this
                 severe exploitation, little is known about the species'
                 life history and population status. Silky sharks, like
                 many other sharks, exhibit slow growth and low
                 fecundity, indicating the urgency of developing
                 assessment studies to aid in the implementation of
                 conservation plans for their stocks. Because
                 information on the catch and effort of this species is
                 scarce, some length-based data-limited methods were
                 applied in the present study to provide estimates of
                 the status of the tropical Pacific silky shark
                 population. As evident from the LBSPR analysis, the
                 current spawning potential ratio (SPR) was found to be
                 below the target reference point of SPR 40\% and
                 slightly above the limit reference point of SPR 20\%.
                 In addition, the LBB model also confirmed that this
                 stock's status is overfished with relatively low
                 biomass levels. Furthermore, both models showed
                 estimates of size selectivity at 50\% and 95\% that
                 were lower than the estimated size at sexual maturity.
                 In conclusion, the data-limited models developed in
                 this study indicated that the silky shark stock in the
                 tropical Pacific Ocean may be at risk of further
                 decline. Additionally, the results show that growth and
                 recruitment overfishing may be occurring in the silky
                 shark's population calling for immediate
                 intensification of monitoring programs for these sharks
                 as a pre-requisite to develop efficient management and

                 under-ice eDNA sampling to monitor the population and
                 confirm overwintering locations. From 2018 to 2020,
                 water samples were collected from transects spanning 35
                 km of the Miramichi River system, accounting for the
                 effects of sampling site, month, sampling depth and
                 tidal influence on eDNA concentration. We examined the
                 distribution of eDNA in a complex tidal river system
                 with a time series consisting of 12 h of continuous
                 sampling throughout a tidal cycle, in conjunction with
                 the use of artificial DNA tracers and acoustic Doppler
                 current profiler flow measurements. The eDNA
                 distribution correctly identified overwintering grounds
                 based on acoustic tag data, including a perceptible
                 upstream shift in 2020. Overall, there was no

                 concentration and distribution allows for a relative
                 comparison of population size and location between
                 years, and has the potential to be expanded to other

  abstract =     "Mitten crab, Eriocheir sensu stricto, is an important
                 indigenous aquatic species and food source in Eastern
                 Asia. Genetic diversity is an important prerequisite
                 for the conservation and utilization of germplasm
                 resources. However, the genetic diversity and
                 differentiation of Eriocheir s. s. remains unclear.
                 This study evaluated population genetic diversity and
                 genetic differentiation of three Eriocheir s. s.
                 populations from Suifenhe (SFH), Liaohe (LH), and
                 Nanliujiang (NLJ), China, based on 19 microsatellite
                 markers. The mean observed number of alleles (N a) was
                 22.84 alleles, and the mean polymorphism information
                 content (PIC) was 0.86, which demonstrated high genetic
                 diversity. The allele frequency distribution showed an
                 ``L'' shape, ranging from 0.01 to 0.74. The genetic
                 diversity parameter values of the LH population were
                 higher than those of the other two populations. All
                 pairwise F ST values showed significant differences
                 among the three Eriocheir s. s. populations (p {$<$}
                 0.01). The value of Nei's genetic distance (D S) varied
                 from 0.31 (between SFH and NLJ populations) to 0.33
                 (between SFH and LH populations). Overall, The results
                 illustrate that the three wild Eriocheir s. s.
                 populations have high genetic diversity and high
                 genetic differentiation. This study provides the basis
                 for Eriocheir s. s. utilization in China.",

                 the marine ecosystems and are an important commercial
                 species in the East Pacific. Generally, three size
                 groups have been distinguished on the basis of the
                 mantle length (ML) of an adult. Here, fatty acid (FA)
                 analyses of muscle tissues were used to explore the
                 feeding strategies of D. gigas off the Peruvian
                 exclusive economic zone in terms of different size
                 groups and sexes. There was no significant difference
                 in fatty acid composition between the small- and
                 medium-sized groups, whereas the large-sized group
                 differed significantly from other groups. The higher
                 content of C20:4n6 and (C18:2n6 + C18:3n3) indicates
                 that the large-sized group may feed more frequently in

                 the three size groups were consistent with the results
                 of fatty acid composition, with the large-sized group
                 occupying the widest trophic niche, followed by the
                 medium-sized group and then the small-sized group. In
                 addition, there was evidence of trophic niche overlap

                 variability of the small and medium groups, the fatty

                 strategies may be adopted by them. This study revealed
                 the variability of the feeding strategies of three size

                 lumpus) as cleaner fish to control Lepeophtheirus
                 salmonis infestations on farmed Atlantic salmon
                 (\bioname{Salmo salar} {L.}). The review was prompted
                 by recent reports in which the usefulness of lumpfish
                 has been doubted, and the urgent need to investigate
                 whether common lumpfish can be used to reduce L.
                 salmonis numbers on farmed Atlantic salmon by active
                 grazing on this species. Available published data
                 clearly indicate that lumpfish graze on L. salmonis,
                 and can significantly lower the lice burden in Atlantic
                 salmon farming. It is possible to enhance the lice
                 grazing behavior of lumpfish with the assistance of
                 live feed conditioning prior to sea pen transfer, and
                 with selective breeding. Data indicate that lice
                 grazing of lumpfish is size dependent, and grazing
                 effect is low for lumpfish larger than 200--250 g.
                 Observations from large-scale rearing of Atlantic
                 salmon in open sea cages in Norway, Iceland, the Faroe
                 Islands, and Scotland also indicate that lumpfish can
                 be effective in lowering infestations of L. salmonis on
                 salmon. Overall, this present review reveals that
                 lumpfish can actively contribute to lower numbers of L.

                 potential marine resource in the open South China Sea
                 (SCS). However, little is known about the spatial and
                 temporal distribution of its habitat, and how this may
                 respond to environmental changes. Using fish survey and
                 remote sensing data from 2015--2019, we applied
                 generalized additive models to identify relationships
                 between environmental factors and the distribution of
                 A. thazard in the SCS. To examine seasonal patterns in
                 the habitat of A. thazard in the SCS, we generated a
                 habitat suitability index model using environmental
                 factors screened by generalized additive models.
                 Results showed that A. thazard migrates from south to
                 north in the SCS, and its suitable habitat is patchily
                 distributed. Significant environmental factors
                 affecting the habitat of A. thazard distribution were
                 different in different seasons; we demonstrated A.
                 thazard to be sensitive to Chl-a in spring (optimum
                 0.155, optimal range $ \approx $0.1252--0.1840), and in
                 summer to be sensitive to SST (optimum 30.405, optimal
                 range $ \approx $29.789--31.021) and SSH (optimum
                 0.741, optimal range $ \approx $0.618--0.864). Suitable
                 habitat in spring occurs mainly in northeastern areas,
                 while in summer it occurs mainly around the

                 arsenic (As) on the morpho-behavior, growth development
                 and molecular mechanisms of a commercially important
                 fish, rohu carp, Labeo rohita, in Bangladesh. Fish fry
                 with an average weight of 387.5 {\pm} 169.25 mg and an
                 average length of 3.35 {\pm} 0.37 cm were collected
                 from a local hatchery in Mymensingh, Bangladesh and
                 acclimatized for a week in the Department of Fisheries,
                 University of Dhaka before starting the exposure with
                 arsenic. Fishes were exposed for a period of 14 days
                 with three treatments of NaAsO 2, namely treatment
                 1(T1)---2.5 mg/L; treatment 2 (T2)---15 mg/L; and
                 treatment 3 (T3)---30 mg/L, along with a control
                 (C)---0.0 mg/L, with three replicates. These
                 concentrations were determined based on the LC 50 value
                 for 96 h measured for this experiment. This study
                 revealed remarkable morphological abnormalities and
                 deformities in arsenic-exposed rohu carp. In fish
                 exposed to 30 mg/L, caudal fin erosion was a frequent
                 deformity. There was no significant difference in
                 RNA:DNA ratio among the treatments. The overall weight
                 of fish was decreased as the concentration of arsenic
                 was increased. The T3 fish had a statistically
                 significant negative weight gain ({$-$0}.05 {\pm} 0.07
                 g), but the other treatments (T1 and T2) and control
                 fish had no significant weight gain. Different types of
                 histopathological changes were observed in the gills
                 and intestines of arsenic-treated fish. Necrosis and
                 severe damages were found in the secondary lamellae of
                 gills at the highest arsenic concentration (30 mg/L).
                 Epithelial lifting, irregular shape and damages in the
                 gill raker were also observed in the primary lamellae
                 of the gills for the same treatment. In this study, the
                 expression of heat shock protein (HSP 60) and
                 metallothionein (MT) genes was assessed by qPCR, and
                 these genes were upregulated in different treatments
                 compared to controls. The findings of the present study
                 suggest that arsenic pollution significantly changes
                 the morphology, behavior, growth, development,
                 histopathology and molecular mechanisms of this
                 economically important fish, rohu carp, in

                 most important food fishes in global aquaculture. The
                 optimal rearing temperature for Nile tilapia is 27--30
                 {$^\circ $}C; however, in some Asian breeding areas,
                 such as south China, water temperatures in summer
                 frequently exceed 35 {$^\circ $}C for several days.
                 Potential effects of long-term exposure to high
                 temperatures on the survival and metabolism of tilapia
                 are unclear. In this study, genetically improved farmed
                 tilapia, age six weeks, were exposed to water
                 temperatures of 28, 32, and 36 {$^\circ $}C for 15
                 weeks. Mean survival rates and tolerance to hypoxia
                 were significantly reduced, and respiratory rates were
                 increased in fish reared at 36 {$^\circ $}C, compared
                 to the 28 and 32 {$^\circ $}C treatments (p {$<$}
                 0.05). Partial temperature compensation for routine
                 metabolic rates was observed after 15 weeks at 36
                 {$^\circ $}C. Gill morphology changes in the 36
                 {$^\circ $}C treatment included curling of the lamellae
                 and hyperplasia of the filament end, which became more
                 pronounced after acute hypoxia (0.2 mg/L O 2).
                 Transcriptomics demonstrated that expression of
                 numerous genes related to aerobic metabolism was
                 altered in the 36 {$^\circ $}C treatment, including
                 down-regulation of nine genes of the tricarboxylic acid
                 cycle. In summary, high temperature affected tilapia
                 gill morphology, reduced hypoxia tolerance, and
                 inhibited aerobic metabolism, thus ultimately

                 fisheries biology, especially age and population
                 structure. Based on the 296 samples collected by the
                 Chinese commercial jigging vessel in December 2018 in
                 the Japan Sea. The age, growth, and population
                 structure of B. magister shevtsovi were studied based
                 on the microstructure of the statolith. The results
                 indicated that the range of mantle length (ML) was
                 90--148 mm for females and 94--141 mm for males, the
                 body weight (BW) ranged from 49 to 116 g and 38 to 110
                 g for females and males, and the ages were estimated
                 from 52 to 166 days for females and 51 to 143 days for
                 males, respectively. The hatching date extended from

                 between the sexes in the relationship between ML--age
                 and BW--age. The relationship between the ML and BW was
                 best described by the power function, the ML--age
                 relationship of females was best described by linear

                 relationships of females and males were best described
                 by the exponential function. B. magister shevtsovi is a

                 high at the young life stage and decreased after the
                 subadult stage (60--120 days older). This study

                 specific growth rate, weight gain rate, total
                 production and net production, was significantly higher
                 in the treatment groups compared to the control (p
                 {$<$} 0.05), while there was no significant difference
                 in those of C. carpio between the two groups. Feed was
                 the main N ({$>$92}\%) and P ({$>$95}\%) input during
                 the experiment. Comprehensive accumulation was the main
                 N ({$>$58}\%) and P ({$>$69}\%) output. The N and P
                 feed input and comprehensive accumulation output
                 declined in the treatment group. The N utilization
                 efficiency in the experimental group increased slightly
                 ($ p < 0.05$), while the P utilization efficiency in
                 the experimental group was significantly higher
                 compared to the control ($ p < 0.05$). Therefore, the
                 application of eco-substrates and carbon addition can
                 increase water quality, improve fish growth, and
                 promote nutrient utilization efficiency in pond
                 polyculture systems.",

                 amphibian, which has an incongruous sex ratio during
                 the artificial breeding process and is sex
                 indistinguishable in appearance. The sex development
                 mechanism of this rare species thus needs to be
                 explored. We therefore conducted this study to explore
                 the molecular mechanisms of sex hallmarks or gonad
                 maintenance genes for CGS. In this study, we sequenced
                 and analyzed the sexually mature male and female gonads
                 of Chinese giant salamanders (CGSs) using RNA-seq
                 technology and found a total of 15,063 differentially
                 expressed genes (DEGs) in the testicular and ovarian
                 tissues, of which 7973 (52.93\%) were expressed in
                 testicular and 7090 (47.07\%) in ovarian tissues.
                 Thirteen gonad DEGs were selected based on gene
                 expression abundance and quantified in the muscle and
                 skin tissues of both male and female CGSs. The results
                 showed that these 13 DEGS, out of the 20 analyzed DEGs,
                 were expressed in both the muscle and skin tissues and
                 only two of them (\gene{Bmp15} and \gene{ZP3}) were
                 consistent in the muscle and skin compared to the
                 gonads of CGSs of the two sexes. Overall, our study
                 should provide an important reference for the
                 sex-characteristics-related genes in this type of

                 All vaccination treatments increased lysozyme and
                 peroxidase activity in skin mucus of Nile tilapia by
                 1.2- to 1.5-fold compared to their activities in

                 activities in the blood serum of the vaccinated fish
                 were 1.2- to 1.5-times higher than in the unvaccinated

                 of the vaccine was comparable to that of vaccine

                 plants (\bioname{Lactuca sativa}) reared in aquaponics.
                 Ninety juvenile sea bass with an average body weight of
                 21.55 g/individual were placed in aquaponic fish tanks,
                 together with 24 lettuce plants with an average initial
                 height of 8.90 cm/plant and an average number of leaves
                 of 5.75/plant over a 45-day trial period. At the end of
                 that period, all feeding groups exhibited high
                 survival. In fact, {\Zeta}{\Mu}10 and ZM20 groups
                 showed similar fish weight gain and specific growth
                 rate (SGR) ($ p > 0.05$), but significantly lower SGR
                 ($ p < 0.05$) than the FM group. Nevertheless, final
                 fish body weight and length were similar ($ p > 0.05$)
                 for all feeding groups. No plant mortality was observed
                 during the 45-day study period. All three aquaponic
                 systems resulted in similar leaf fresh weight, as well
                 as fresh and dry aerial biomass. At the end of the
                 experimental period, plants in the third system showed
                 higher fresh leaf weight, total weight of fresh leaves,
                 total dry aerial biomass, and total produced biomass
                 compared to the other two systems. The results of the
                 present study show that fish fed with the ZM10 diet had
                 higher weight gain (WG) than fish fed with the ZM20
                 diet, while the SGRs for ZM10 and ZM20 were similar.
                 Both ZM10 and ZM20 diets result in efficient lettuce

                 commercially important aquaculture species mainly found
                 on the southeast coast of China. However, it has been
                 greatly affected by vibriosis in recent years. In this
                 study, FP17 (a potential pathogen) was isolated from a
                 dying ivory shell with ``acute death syndrome'' and
                 confirmed as a pathogen via infectious experiment.
                 Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on the average
                 nucleotide identity (ANI) sequencing of the 16S rRNA
                 gene and housekeeping genes (\gene{ftsz}, \gene{gapA},

                 \gene{topA}) indicated that FP17 was identical to
                 Vibrio tubiashii. Transmission electron microscopy
                 showed that FP17 is curved and has a short rod shape,
                 with a single flagellum. Besides, the calculated LD 50
                 after the intramuscular injection of FP17 was 2.11 $
                 \times $ 10 6 CFU/g at 14 d. The genome of the FP17
                 strain consists of two chromosomes and one plasmid with
                 5,261,336 bp and 45.08\% GC content, including 4824
                 open reading frames (ORFs) and 150 non-coding RNAs
                 (\gene{ncRNA}). Genome mining revealed that 120
                 candidate gene clusters, including vibrioferrin and
                 flagellum-related proteins, are responsible for
                 virulence. Comparative genomic analysis showed that
                 vibrioferrin genes, such as pvs and type
                 \SGMLentity{8549} secretion system protein genes
                 (\gene{vas}), are specific in \bioname{V. tubiashii}

  abstract =     "Most of world's fish and seafood are produced by
                 aquaculture, which is one of the biggest contributors
                 to the world's food security. The substantial increase
                 in prices of conventional feed ingredients and the
                 over-exploitation of natural resources are some of the
                 biggest constraints to aquaculture production. To
                 overcome this stress, different approaches and
                 techniques are used, among which the use of
                 non-conventional feed ingredients in the aquaculture
                 sector is the most recent approach. Different
                 non-conventional feed ingredients such as plant-based
                 products, algae (both micro and macroalgae),
                 single-cell protein (bacteria and yeast), and insect
                 meal are currently used in aquaculture for sustainable
                 food production. Amongst all these novel ingredients,
                 insects have greater potential to replace fishmeal. The
                 existence of about 1.3 billion tons of food and
                 agriculture waste from the food chain supply poses a
                 serious environmental threat. Insects are tiny
                 creatures that can thrive on organic waste and thus can
                 convert the waste to wealth by the bioconversion and
                 nutritional upcycling of organic waste. Insects have
                 the potential to recover nutrients from waste
                 aquaculture products, and many fish species feed on
                 insects naturally. Therefore, employing insects in the
                 aquaculture sector to replace fishmeal is an
                 eco-friendly approach. The present review briefly
                 highlights emerging non-conventional feed ingredients,
                 with special attention given to insects. The current
                 review also focuses on the nutritional value of
                 insects, factors affecting the nutritional value of
                 insects, potential insects that can be employed in the
                 aquaculture sector, the physiological response of fish
                 when fed with insect meal, techno-functional properties
                 of insect meal, and emerging approaches for addressing
                 possible downsides of employing insect meal in fish
                 diets. Finally, it suggests avenues for further

  abstract =     "Investigation of the use of fish scales as a medium
                 for non-lethal biomonitoring has recently commenced.
                 Fish scales have been shown to incorporate cortisol
                 over longer periods of time than blood and thus provide
                 a promising means of assessing long-term stress in many
                 species of teleost fish. However, while cortisol is a
                 major mediator of the stress response in fishes,
                 downstream effects of chronic stress on reproduction
                 can involve gonadal steroids such as progesterone and
                 testosterone. The quantification of these additional
                 hormones alongside cortisol could therefore allow for
                 the assessment of both stress and consequential
                 reproductive alterations. To investigate these
                 concepts, we artificially elevated circulating
                 cortisol, progesterone, and testosterone in rainbow
                 trout (\bioname{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) using coconut oil
                 implants for three weeks. Following this we quantified
                 these three hormones as well as 11-ketotestosterone, a
                 potent androgen in teleost fishes. In all cases serum
                 samples reflected a significant increase in the
                 injected hormone confirming the efficacy of this
                 method; however, this did not result in significantly
                 elevated scale concentrations of the same hormone in
                 all cases. As the stress and reproductive axes are
                 closely integrated, these findings are likely a result
                 of interactions along the steroidogenic pathway
                 indicating that a further investigation of the
                 relationship between scale concentrations of these
                 hormones and actual physiological processes is
                 required. Nevertheless, the successful quantification
                 of both stress and gonadal steroid hormones within the
                 scale suggests that such measurements could provide a
                 novel and informative tool in the assessment of
                 long-term stress and the resulting effects on
                 reproductive endocrinology in teleost fishes.",

                 factors in vertebrates; however, little is known about
                 the Sox family in Lutraria sieboldii. L. sieboldii are
                 pleasant to eat with a short growth cycle and have
                 become one of the best bottom-seeded enrichment species

                 from \bioname{L. sieboldii} were cloned, and their
                 expression patterns were analyzed. The length of the
                 \gene{LsSox 2} gene coding sequence was 1011 bp,
                 encoding 336 amino acids, and \gene{LsSox 9} was 1449
                 bp, encoding 482 amino acids. \gene{LsSox 2} had its
                 highest expression levels in the ovary, which were 356
                 times those in testis, whereas \gene{LsSox 9} presented
                 higher expression in testis, which was 6 times more

                 exhibited the highest expression during the morula
                 stage, which was 20 times that of the D-shaped larvae
                 or zygote. \gene{LsSox 9} exhibited two expression
                 peaks, one at the four-cell stage and the other at the
                 trochophore stage, while the lowest expression was in
                 the zygote. \gene{LsSox 9} was 73 times more highly
                 expressed in the four-cell stage than in the zygote
                 stage. During gonadal development, \gene{LsSox 2}
                 presented the highest expression in the mature ovary,
                 which was 756 times more highly expressed than in

                 survival and development of fishery resources, and
                 changes in the marine environment affect the fishery
                 economy. Therefore, against the background of
                 sustainability and environmental uncertainty, it is
                 important to investigate the development of the marine
                 environment and the marine fishery economy to improve
                 the quality of both. Taking the panel data for 11
                 coastal cities in China from 2011 to 2020, we use
                 several methods, including the entropy method, a
                 coupling harmonious degree model, and a Tobit model, to
                 measure the marine-environment quality and
                 marine-fishery-economy quality, their coordination, and
                 the factors affecting that coordination. We find that
                 (1) the marine-environment quality and marine-fishery
                 economy quality show a significant upward trend over
                 time, but they are spatially unbalanced, with obvious
                 interprovincial differences. (2) Coordination between
                 the marine-environment quality and
                 marine-fishery-economy quality has risen steadily, but
                 the level of coordination is still low, remaining at
                 the primary level in most areas. (3) The important
                 factors affecting coordination between the
                 marine-environment quality and marine-fishery-economy
                 quality include the strength of the marine fishery
                 industry, scale of the marine fishery economy,
                 production capacity of marine fisheries,
                 marine-environment quality, and quality of the marine
                 environment and its resources. In light of these
                 findings, we should increase the coordination between
                 the marine-environment quality and
                 marine-fishery-economy quality by upgrading the marine

                 alternative protein sources necessary. Insect meals are
                 considered a promising substitute to replace FM. In a
                 90-day experiment, 6 diets with different replacement
                 levels of FM by partially defatted black soldier fly

                 were high (95.8--100\%) without differences between

                 optimal level of FM replacement was 47\% (356 g BSFLM
                 kg {$-$1} diet). Externally visible deformities were
                 always under 0.05\%. The whole-body lipid content of
                 the fish had a significantly negative linear regression
                 with BSFLM (r 2 = 0.80). The content of the essential
                 amino acids (EAA) arginine, leucine, lysine,
                 phenylalanine, methionine, and threonine in diets
                 decreased with dietary BSFLM inclusion. However, it did
                 not have a negative effect on growth performance,
                 suggesting that EAA requirements were covered. The
                 amount of essential amino acids in whole-body juveniles

                 biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The
                 BBNJ Agreement, which focuses on biodiversity in areas
                 beyond national jurisdiction, is under vigorous
                 discussion. Subject to the ``not undermine''

                 it is highly possible that the BBNJ Agreement may not

                 transforming marine management mode, the issue of
                 high-seas fisheries should be included in the BBNJ

  abstract =     "The Antarctic continent is one of the most pristine
                 environments on planet Earth, yet one of the most
                 fragile and susceptible to the effects of the ongoing
                 climate change. The overwhelming majority of the
                 components of Antarctic marine trophic chain are
                 stenotherm organisms, highly adapted to the extreme,
                 but extremely stable, freezing temperatures of the
                 Antarctic ocean, which have not changed significantly
                 during the past fifteen million years. Notothenioid
                 fishes are the most abundant representatives of
                 ichthyofauna at these latitudes, being ubiquitously
                 found in coastal areas across the entire continent.
                 While different Antarctic fish species have been
                 previously subjected to studies aimed at defining their
                 range of thermal tolerance, or at studying the response
                 to acute thermal stress, just a handful of authors have
                 investigated the effects of the exposure to a moderate
                 increase of temperature, falling within the expected
                 forecasts for the next few decades in some areas of the
                 Antarctica. Here, the emerald rockcod Trematomus
                 bernacchii was used as a model species to investigate
                 the effects of a 20-day long exposure to a +1.5
                 {$^\circ $} C increase in the brain, gills and skeletal
                 muscle, using a RNA-sequencing approach. In parallel,
                 the experimental design also allowed for assessing the
                 impact of stabling (including acclimation, the handling
                 of fishes and their confinement in tanks during the
                 experimental phase) on gene expression profiling. The
                 results of this study clearly identified the brain as
                 the most susceptible tissue to heat stress, with
                 evidence of a time-dependent response dominated by an
                 alteration of immune response, protein synthesis and
                 folding, and energy metabolism-related genes. While the
                 gills displayed smaller but still significant
                 alterations, the skeletal muscle was completely
                 unaffected by the experimental conditions. The stabling
                 conditions also had an important impact on gene
                 expression profiles in the brain, suggesting the
                 presence of significant alterations of the fish nervous
                 system, possibly due to the confinement to tanks with
                 limited water volume and of the restricted possibility
                 of movement. Besides providing novel insights in the
                 molecular mechanisms underlying thermal stress in
                 notothenioids, these findings suggest that more
                 attention should be dedicated to an improved design of
                 the experiments carried out on Antarctic organism, due
                 to their extreme susceptibility to the slightest
                 environmental alterations.",

                 NPUST1 at doses of 10 6 and 10 7 CFU/g for 8 weeks.
                 There was an obvious increase in the hepatic mRNA

                 including glucokinase, hexokinase 1,

  abstract =     "Fish vaccination plays a vital role in the prevention
                 of fish diseases. Inappropriate injection positions
                 will cause a low immunization rate and even death.
                 Currently, traditional visual algorithms have poor
                 robustness and low accuracy due to the specificity of
                 the placement of turbot fins in the application of
                 automatic vaccination machines. To address this
                 problem, we propose a new method for estimating the
                 injection position of the turbot based on semantic
                 segmentation. Many semantic segmentation networks were
                 used to extract the background, fish body, pectoral
                 fin, and caudal fin. In the subsequent step, the
                 segmentations obtained from the best network were used
                 for calculating body length (BL) and body width (BW).
                 These parameters were employed for estimating the
                 injection position. The proposed Atten-Deeplabv3+
                 achieved the best segmentation results for intersection
                 over union (IoU) on the test set, with 99.3, 96.5,
                 85.8, and 91.7 percent for background, fish body,
                 pectoral fin, and caudal fin, respectively. On this
                 basis, the estimation error of the injection position
                 was 0.2 mm--4.4 mm, which is almost within the
                 allowable injection area. In conclusion, the devised
                 method was able to correctly differentiate the fish
                 body from the background and fins, meaning that the
                 extracted area could be successfully used for the
                 estimation of injection position.",

                 one of the high-income-generating carangid fish species
                 and the only known member of its genus. This study aims
                 to identify existing gaps in stock status and
                 population demography of this species and provide
                 viable management recommendations to enhance the
                 sustainability of this fishery. Therefore, three
                 methodological approaches have been used in this study;
                 TropFishR to present the current exploitation status,
                 the length-based spawning potential ratio (LB-SPR) to
                 quantify stock spawning biomass, and Froese's
                 sustainability indicators (LBI) to establish a basic
                 standard for sustainable management of the fishery. In
                 the length--weight relationship of black pomfret, an
                 allometric growth pattern ($ b = 2.19$) was found. The
                 VBGF life history parameters for black pomfret were L
                 {\infty} = 55.25 cm, K = 0.54 year {$-$1}, and based on
                 LCCC analysis, the total mortality ($ Z = 1.61$ year -
                 1), natural mortality ($ M = 0.69$ year - 1) and
                 fishing mortality ($ F = 0.91$ year -1) are calculated.
                 The result reveals that this fishery is currently
                 suffering from overexploitation and the stock's
                 spawning biomass (SPR = 13\%) is below the limit
                 reference point because most of the catch (82\%) was
                 found to be under the maturity level. Based on the
                 results, this study recommended strictly maintaining
                 the mesh size of the net to ensure not to catch
                 immature fish with a length smaller than 30.63 cm,
                 recommended the length to catch be between 29 and 35
                 cm, and reducing fishing pressure by one-third to

                 biodiversity distributions. There is still limited
                 knowledge for freshwater fish species despite the
                 importance of focusing conservation efforts towards
                 this group due to their alarming extinction risk and
                 the increasing human pressure on freshwater ecosystems.
                 Here, we addressed the Wallacean shortfall for
                 freshwater fish faunas across Europe by using the
                 completeness indicator derived from species
                 accumulation curves to quantify the fish sampling
                 efforts. The multiple potential drivers of completeness
                 that were previously related to the sampling efforts
                 for other species (i.e., population density, nature
                 reserves, or distance to cities) were tested using a 10
                 $ \times $ 10 km 2 grid resolution, as well as
                 environmental (e.g., climatic) factors. Our results
                 suggested that although there was an overall spatial
                 pattern at the European level, the completeness was
                 highly country-dependent. Accessibility parameters
                 explained the sampling efforts, as for other taxa.
                 Likewise, climate factors were related to survey
                 completeness, possibly pointing to the river conditions
                 required for fish sampling. The survey effort map we
                 provide can be used to optimize future sampling, aiming
                 at filling the data gaps in undersampled regions like
                 the eastern European countries, as well as to account
                 for the current bias in any ecological modeling using

                 lake management strategy in various regions of China as
                 ecological development is given more attention.
                 Nevertheless, little is known about the substantive
                 impact of this measure on fish communities in inland
                 lakes. To this end, the fish community composition and
                 structural features after the removal of the net
                 enclosure in Gehu Lake were explored and evaluated in
                 this study from 2021 to 2022 and compared to the
                 investigation before the net enclosure removal from
                 2017 to 2018. Belonging to 7 orders, 10 families, and
                 46 species, a total of 17,151 fish were collected, with
                 pelagic, sedentary, and omnivorous species dominating.
                 In comparison, the number of species increased by 10
                 after removal, and fish alpha diversity increased. The
                 Index of Relative Importance (IRI) revealed that the
                 composition of dominating species remained constant,
                 including Coilia nasus, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix,
                 and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis; Parabramis pekinensis,
                 Megalobrama amblycephal, and Culter mongolicus were
                 upgraded from common species to general species. Culter
                 alburnus, Hemiculter bleekeri, and Pseudobrama simoni
                 were downgraded from general species to common species.
                 Elopichthys bambusa had become a common species (IRI =
                 109.35), which was not discovered before removal.
                 According to the hierarchical clustering (HC) and
                 non-metric multidimensional sequencing (NMDS), the fish
                 community of the northern reserve was highly
                 aggregated. As the Abundance Biomass Comparison (ABC)
                 curve and biodiversity index indicated, the fish
                 community structure of the whole lake was in a state of
                 moderate anthropogenic disturbance with reduced
                 stability, while that of the northern reserve was in a
                 state of light anthropogenic disturbance with greater
                 stability. The number of fish species increased in this
                 survey compared to the period before removal, species
                 and dominant species composition altered dramatically,
                 and total lake stability declined. This study
                 demonstrates that the fish diversity in Gehu Lake

                 purpuratus industry in Chile shows the progression from
                 resource extraction (fishing) to production
                 (aquaculture). This paper analyses the effects of
                 environmental, economic, and scientific--technological
                 factors. The influence of each factor on scallop
                 production in Chile was reviewed for the period between
                 the 1980s and 2020. The evaluation of the effects
                 allows the visualisation of the industry's productive
                 evolution and reveals the current challenges. The
                 occurrence of abrupt environmental disturbances,
                 commercialisation under imperfect market
                 configurations, and public and private efforts in
                 scientific and technological advances have acted
                 favourably on scallop production. However, an industry
                 mainly focused on prices and high production volumes
                 did not devote much effort to develop low-cost
                 climate-resilient technologies. Today, economic
                 challenges must be addressed by helping to reduce
                 production costs and add economic value to products and
                 by-products. Our results show that the industry must
                 focus on low-cost technologies, the use of renewable
                 energy, and the circularity of its processes. The
                 environment ensures the capture of natural seeds and
                 their adaptation to climate change. These challenges
                 must not lose sight of the emerging effects of the
                 COVID-19 pandemic.",

                 a formulated diet to replace live baits as feed for
                 Siniperca chuatsi. A 2 $ \times $ 2 factorial design
                 with three replicates was used to investigate the
                 effects of conventional live baits (LB) and a
                 formulated diet (FD) on the growth, muscle nutrition
                 composition, and digestive enzyme activities of S.
                 chuatsi at two growth stages. The results showed that
                 the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the FD group was
                 significantly lower than that in the LB group. The
                 final body weight (FBW) and weight gain (WG) were not
                 significantly different between the two feeding modes.
                 However, at the juvenile stage, the specific growth
                 rate (SGR) in the FD group was significantly lower than
                 that in the LB group. Muscle moisture, crude protein,
                 and crude lipid contents were not influenced by dietary
                 treatments. There were no significant differences in
                 {\SGMLsum}EAA, {\SGMLsum}NEAA, and {\SGMLsum}AA
                 compositions of the juvenile and adult stages fed the
                 two kinds of diets. At the juvenile stage, histidine
                 (His) content in the FD group was significantly higher
                 than that in the LB group; at the adult stage, cysteine
                 (Cys) content in the FD group was significantly higher
                 than that in the LB group; at both growth stages, Met
                 content in the FD group was significantly lower than
                 that in the LB group. The FD group showed higher levels
                 of {\SGMLsum}SFA, {\SGMLsum}HUFA, {\SGMLsum}n-3PUFA,
                 n-3/n-6, EPA, and DHA than the LB group did, whilst the
                 opposite occurred in the MUFA levels. In addition, fish
                 fed with LB had significantly higher values of pepsin
                 and intestinal trypsin activities in the juvenile fish
                 compared to the FD group, but the activities were not
                 significantly different between the two feeding modes
                 at the adult stage. The activities of stomach and
                 intestine amylase in the FD group were significantly
                 higher than those in the LB group. Overall, these
                 results showed that under long-term feeding conditions,
                 S. chuatsi fed with the artificial diet had no
                 significant difference in muscle crude protein, crude
                 lipid, amino acid composition, and digestive capacity,
                 but showed superiority in the composition of fatty
                 acids such as EPA and DHA levels compared to the live
                 baits group. Therefore, the artificially formulated
                 diet might be a more appropriate feeding approach for
                 sustainable development of the S. chuatsi industry.",

                 Ctenopharyngodon idellus when the common reed
                 Phragmites australis is in its diet, instead of wheat
                 Triticum aestivum L. Seventy-two healthy grass carps
                 (145.52 {\pm} 2.56 g) were randomly divided into three
                 groups according to their body weight. Fishes in each
                 group were fed an essential diet with 0\% (control
                 group), 50\% and 100\% (test group) common reed,

                 tissue structure and immune related indices of grass
                 carp were detected. The results showed that, compared

                 transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in
                 the substitution groups were significantly increased ($
                 p < 0.05$), but still at a normal level. The contents
                 of total protein, albumin and globulin did not change
                 significantly ($ p > 0.05$). Compared with the control
                 group, the liver cells of grass carp in the
                 substitution groups had clear boundaries, tight
                 arrangement and less vacuolation. The contents of serum
                 interleukin-1 (IL-1) and complement 3 (C3) in the 100\%
                 substitution group were significantly higher than those
                 in the control group ($ p < 0.05$), and the contents of
                 liver IL-1 and total complement (CH50) in the 100\%
                 substitution group were significantly higher than those
                 in the control group ($ p < 0.05$). The contents of
                 IL-1, C3 in serum and IL-1, CH50 in liver in the 50\%
                 substitution group were significantly higher than those
                 in the control group ($ p < 0.05$). The mRNA relative
                 expression levels of C3, IL-1, MHC-I and interferon
                 (IFN) in the head-kidney, kidney, liver and spleen of
                 grass carp were significantly affected by feeding the
                 grass carp with different common reed substitution

                 plays a critical role in glutamate production and
                 improvement of meat flavor. In this study, a gls1 gene
                 encoding 595 amino acids was cloned from triploid
                 crucian carp (\bioname{Carassius auratus}) (TCC) and
                 showed a high similarity with the gls1 gene found in
                 Cyprinus carpio, Sinocyclocheilus rhinocerous and
                 Puntigrus tetrazona. Comparing the abundance of gls1 in
                 different tissues, we found its expression level in the
                 brain and liver were significantly higher than that in
                 heart, gut, kidney, spleen and muscle. gls1 expression
                 in the brain reached the highest value. In addition,
                 the expression levels of gls1 also appeared different
                 in diurnal variation, with the highest expression seen
                 at 9:00, while it was low at 3:00, 6:00, 15:00 and
                 24:00. Furthermore, dietary regulation of gls1
                 expression was investigated in our study. In each
                 feeding trial, each diet was randomly assigned to
                 triplicate tanks. Fish were fed one of the tested diets
                 up to satiation twice daily. The results showed that
                 gls1 expression increased in 32\% protein group and
                 decreased in 35--41\% protein group. The results of
                 different protein source experiments showed that the
                 expression of gls1 gene in the mixed protein group (the
                 control group) was significantly higher than that in
                 the fish meal and soybean meal groups. Glutamate
                 treatment revealed that appropriate concentrations
                 (0.10 mg/mL in vivo and 2.00\% in vitro) of glutamate
                 remarkably improved the expression of gls1. Besides,
                 diets supplemented with 0.80--1.60\% lysine-glutamate
                 dipeptide exhibited a down regulatory impact on gls1
                 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that
                 the expression of gls1 in TCC was increased by 32\%
                 protein diet, mixed protein source diet and diet with
                 2.00\% glutamate concentration, while decreased by
                 0.80--1.60\% lysine-glutamate dipeptide. The findings
                 of this study provide a reference for the regulation of
                 gls1 and have a potential application in the
                 optimization of dietary formula in aquaculture.",

                 regime in the seas and oceans of our planet. The
                 mitochondrial complex of nuclear erythrocytes of
                 cartilaginous fish, as the energy basis of blood cells,
                 has repeatedly encountered such climatic fluctuations
                 throughout their evolutionary history. In this regard,
                 the features of the adaptive strategy of the
                 erythrocyte mitochondrial complex in the thornback ray
                 (\bioname{Raja clavata} {L.}) are of interest from the
                 evolutionary and ecological points of view. The rate of
                 oxygen consumption in resuspended (Ht = 25--30\%)
                 erythrocytes taken from the Black Sea thornback ray in
                 saline was studied by the polarographic method. A high
                 ``basal'' rate of respiration in the erythrocytes of
                 the thornback ray was shown, which ranged from 10.5 to
                 21.6 pmol O 2 min {$-$1} {\cdot}10 6 cells. The
                 addition of substrates of the mitochondrial respiration
                 activators glutamate, maleate, and succinate to the
                 erythrocyte suspension caused a 2--6-fold increase in
                 the respiratory activity of thornback ray erythrocytes.
                 In cases where the rate of respiration of erythrocytes
                 was high, protonophore--dinitrophenol caused an
                 inhibition of the activity of mitochondrial
                 respiration. At low respiration rates of erythrocytes,
                 its effect was opposite and caused a stimulation of
                 mitochondrial respiration. Oligomycin caused a
                 significant inhibition of the respiratory activity of
                 the red blood cell suspension of the thornback ray.
                 This suppression of cell respiration was enhanced under
                 conditions of exposure to the permeabilization of
                 erythrocytes with digitonin. This can be recommended as
                 one of the ways to block the respiratory activity of
                 erythrocytes in cartilaginous fish. Another way of
                 effectively blocking the respiration of the
                 mitochondrial complex of the thornback ray's
                 erythrocytes was the effect of the blockers rotenone
                 and sodium azide. The peculiarity of the mitochondria
                 of the erythrocytes of the thornback ray was the
                 absence of the complete inhibition of respiration by
                 sodium azide (NaN 3), which is characteristic of the
                 mitochondria of other fish species. Our data on the
                 activation of the ``respiration'' of erythrocytes in
                 fish indicate that the potential capabilities of
                 cold-blooded and warm-blooded vertebrates have rather
                 similar characteristics. This may indicate the initial
                 ``laying'' of the architecture of the inner membrane to
                 support the energy potential of the mitochondria of the
                 cell.",

                 Determining the suitable timing and size of live or

                 1191 bp, encoding 102 and 396 amino acids,
                 respectively. The results of protein domain prediction
                 show that Eh-HSP10 has a Cpn10 domain. The Eh-HSP40
                 protein contains a DnaJ domain, which is characteristic
                 of the HSP 40 gene family. The results of qRT-PCR show
                 that the Eh-HSP 10 and Eh-HSP 40 genes were expressed
                 in different normal tissues, with the highest
                 expression in the heart. Under Vibrio parahaemolyticus
                 stress, the Eh-HSP 10 genes peaked at 6 h, and the
                 Eh-HSP40 peaked at 9 h in the hepatopancreas. In the
                 gill, Eh-HSP10 showed a double peak at 24 and 48 h, and
                 the expression of Eh-HSP40 was time-dependent. In the
                 heart, the expression of Eh-HSP10 increased first and
                 then decreased, whereas Eh-HSP40 peaked at 48 h. The
                 results indicate that the Eh-HSP10 and Eh-HSP40
                 proteins may play a role in protecting E. hepuensis
                 under V. parahaemolyticus infection and that they may
                 be involved in the innate immune response of E.
                 hepuensis against bacteria.",

  abstract =     "Strontium marking technology is commonly used for
                 extensive marking in stock enhancement and releasing
                 activities. In order to explore the feasibility of this
                 technology for juvenile Takifugu obscurus, five
                 different concentrations of strontium (0, 12, 18, 36,
                 and 72 mg/L) were set up by strontium chloride
                 hexahydrate (SrCl 2 {\cdot}6H 2 O) and T. obscurus were
                 immersed for 7 days. Then, T. obscurus were reared in
                 non-additive water for 25 days. The results showed that
                 the survival rate of all groups was 100\%, except the
                 72 mg/L group, after 7 days of immersion. Moreover, the
                 growths of all the marked groups were better than that
                 of the control group. There was no significant
                 difference between the control and marked groups,
                 except for the 18 mg/L group, indicating that the
                 appropriate concentration of strontium might have
                 positive effect for T. obscurus. The strontium to
                 calcium (Sr / Ca) ratios of otoliths in the marked
                 groups increased with increasing concentration and
                 time, which were higher than the baseline,
                 respectively. Then, the Sr / Ca ratios returned to the
                 original level, but the peak value was still retained,
                 suggesting that the success rate of the strontium
                 marking reached 100\%. Notably, the residual strontium
                 content of 18 mg/L group was insufficient for causing
                 negative effects for T. obscurus after 25 days.
                 Therefore, in consideration of the growth, survival,
                 and effect of strontium marking on otolith, 18 mg/L is
                 an appropriate concentration for strontium marking of
                 juvenile T. obscurus. This study confirmed the
                 feasibility of strontium marking for T. obscurus and
                 provided a new approach to rationally and
                 scientifically evaluate the stock enhancement and
                 releasing efficiency of T. obscurus.",

  abstract =     "Koi herpesvirus (KHV) is a highly contagious virus
                 that causes high mortality in koi and common carp,
                 leading to a reduction in production worldwide. Recent
                 diagnostic tests based on molecular methods alone
                 (nucleic acid amplification) and indirect immunoassay
                 methods (antibody detection) can be confirmed over KHV
                 infections or prior exposure and latent infections.
                 Unfortunately, there is no established method to detect
                 KHV virus particles, especially when virus titers are
                 low. Therefore, we propose an alternative, direct
                 immunoassay method for viral detection using a
                 single-chain variable fragment (scFv), a specific
                 region of IgG antibodies that binds specifically to KHV
                 particles. The results of functional analyses indicated
                 that four putative scFv candidates, C5, F8, F6, and E4,
                 were specific to KHV, but only F6 and C5 had a high
                 binding affinity. The binding characteristics were
                 confirmed by indirect competitive and sandwich
                 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, which indicated
                 that F6 and C5 have a broad penetration area to the
                 binding region and share a similar epitope with
                 commercial KHV monoclonal antibodies. These
                 characteristics were further confirmed by their
                 interactions with purified KHV coat protein by indirect
                 ELISA and Western blot analyses. In conclusion, the F6
                 and C5 scFvs have adequate binding affinity to KHV
                 particles to permit their use in immunoassays.",

                 consisted of a shrimp monoculture of 100 animals/m 2
                 (T0) and three multitrophic cultures with L. vannamei
                 (100 animals/m 2) and with G. birdiae at densities of
                 500 (T500), 1000 (T1000), and 2000 (T2000) g/m 2.

                 either due to natural causes influenced by temperature
                 or management techniques in animal production,
                 affecting their energy metabolism differently,
                 depending on the duration of fasting in days and water
                 temperature. This study showed the effect of different
                 days of fasting before slaughter in rainbow trout by
                 analyzing the intermediary metabolic enzymes in the
                 muscle and liver. For this purpose, a non-fasting group
                 was compared with trout that fasted for 5, 10, and 20
                 days (55, 107, and 200 degree days ({$^\circ $}C d),
                 respectively). A first phase of increased activity of
                 enzymes involved in glycolysis was observed, increasing
                 hexokinase enzyme activity in muscle and pyruvate
                 kinase enzyme activity in muscle and liver. As the
                 fasting days progressed, enzymes involved in the
                 gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways in the liver
                 such as lactate dehydrogenase and glycogen
                 phosphorylase increased their activity regarding the no
                 fasted group. After 20 days of fasting (200 {$^\circ
                 $}C d), lipogenic and protein related enzyme activity
                 depletion was observed, leading to significant changes
                 in energy metabolism. Therefore, prolonged fasting with
                 high degree days duration may compromise the energy
                 supply for the vital development of rainbow trout.",

                 one of the most economically valuable marine fishes in
                 South China. \bioname{Streptococcus agalactiae}, an
                 infectious Gram-positive bacterium that is highly
                 destructive for golden pompano culture, has recently
                 caused massive losses to the golden pompano industry.
                 This study aimed to investigate the dynamic immune
                 response of golden pompano to \bioname{S. agalactiae}
                 infection, using RNA-seq analysis at two different time
                 points after infection. Abundances of differentially
                 expressed genes (DEGs) gradually increased in the liver
                 and spleen 48--120 h post-infection, whereas those in
                 the head kidney were lower at 120 h than at 48 h.
                 Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that genes
                 related to the complement system were continuously
                 transcribed between 48 and 120 h. Metabolic and
                 immune-regulation-related pathways were highly enriched
                 in the liver 48 h after infection. Transcriptome
                 analysis was verified using quantitative PCR for eight
                 genes with similar expression trends. This study
                 revealed the inflammatory response of golden pompano
                 after \bioname{S. agalactiae} infection, including
                 inflammation-related chemokines and signaling pathways.
                 Our findings provide a theoretical basis for studying

                 including decreased pH ({$-$0}.4 units, mean: 7.37),

                 /L, mean: 1.80 mg O 2 /L), or increased temperature
                 (+10 {$^\circ $}C, mean: 17.2 {$^\circ $}C) and
                 compared sea star CF electrolytes and osmolality to

                 and/or coelomocyte counts occurred in all treatment

                 expenditure, respiratory or metabolic derangements, and
                 immunosuppression or inflammation. At baseline, CF
                 potassium and osmolality of all groups combined were
                 significantly higher than tank water, and, after

  abstract =     "Abundance indices are essential data for the
                 application of stock assessment models to obtain fish
                 abundance estimates. Abundance indices have usually
                 been derived from fishery-dependent data, yet the
                 increase in fisheries-independent surveys is now
                 offering new opportunities for these calculations. In
                 this study, we explored the usefulness of
                 ichthyoplankton indices derived from scientific surveys
                 in estimating spawning biomass. In addition, we also
                 investigated whether the strength of the year--class of
                 the commercial cohort of Atlantic hake, as a
                 determinant, could be defined at an early life stage.
                 We used samples collected during the triennial mackerel
                 and horse mackerel egg surveys (MEGS), which cover the
                 hake spawning area in the Bay of Biscay. The biomass
                 indices were determined as the abundance of eggs in the
                 early development stage (stage 1) when transformed into
                 egg production (EP) from 1995 to 2019 in the months of
                 March and April---which is considered a period of high
                 spawning activity for hake in this area. Additionally,
                 we built a metric for larval abundance and converted
                 larval length into age. This was in addition to
                 constructing a pre-recruit year-class index (YCI) while
                 using the EVHOE bottom trawl abundance database for
                 hake for the period of 1997 to 2016. The results of
                 regression analysis of egg production and spawning
                 stock biomass indicate that both parameters are
                 significantly correlated (r = 0.76). By connecting the
                 abundance of eggs and larvae in the adjoining stages,
                 we are able to identify two periods of high mortality
                 associated with the transition from ``yolk-sac-first''
                 to ``feeding larvae'' and ``late larvae-YCI10'', but we
                 were unable to discover when the strength of the
                 recruitment year--class is determined. As such, it
                 appears that for the northern stock of hake,
                 recruitment is established in the late juvenile
                 stages.",

                 ({$>$8} fish/m 2, 44.4\%), reared Nile tilapia

                 in recent decades. Although natural populations of
                 scallops are vulnerable, the queen scallop, Aequipecten
                 opercularis, can represent a possible alternative to

                 quality, biological indices and nutritional quality of
                 the scallop A. opercularis in 1900 L tanks in ex situ
                 conditions. The condition index (CI) and meat yield
                 (MY) peaked in autumn (89.92\% and 40.29\%,
                 respectively). The muscle index (MI) showed the highest
                 peak during the winter season (5.96\%), while the
                 gonadosomatic index (GSI) (34.06\%) peaked in the
                 spring months. Protein content (6.89--9.56 g/100 g),
                 lipids (2.58--2.79 g/100 g) and carbohydrates
                 (0.12--0.33 g/100 g) varied during the study period.
                 Seasonal fluctuations in seawater temperature and pH
                 negatively influenced the CI, MY and protein and lipid
                 content, while positively affecting carbohydrate and
                 moisture content. The most suitable period of the year
                 for the consumption of the scallop A. opercularis was
                 found to be the winter and spring periods, when the
                 scallops achieved their highest nutritional value. It
                 can be stated from this study that queen scallops in
                 the Adriatic Sea have a high nutritional quality and

  abstract =     "Food deprivation is a common stress in crustaceans
                 that can affect their behavior and physiology. In this
                 study, a video recording analysis system was used to
                 compare the predation rate and behavior of the Chinese
                 mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, foraging on the
                 freshwater snail, Bellamya quadrata, under different
                 degrees of food deprivation. The activities of lactate
                 dehydrogenase, {\alpha}-amylase, pepsin, and lipase in
                 the hepatopancreas of crabs were determined after food
                 deprivation for 0, 3, 9, and 15 days. The results
                 showed that the predation and encounter rates of E.
                 sinensis increased and then decreased with an increase
                 in food deprivation time. The proportion of stationary
                 time of E. sinensis initially decreased and then
                 increased, whereas the proportion of searching and
                 handling time increased initially and then decreased.
                 There was a significant difference in the probability
                 of capture upon encountering; however, food deprivation
                 did not significantly affect the probability of
                 consumption upon capture. Under food deprivation, the
                 proportion of E. sinensis crushing tactics after
                 nine-day food deprivation was significantly lower than
                 that in the first nine days. Lactate dehydrogenase
                 activity in the E. sinensis hepatopancreas after food
                 deprivation was significantly higher than that in those
                 not subjected to food deprivation, and the activities
                 of {\alpha}-amylase and pepsin in the hepatopancreas
                 were consistent with the predation rate trend, showing
                 an initial increase followed by a decrease. In
                 conclusion, different degrees of food deprivation
                 significantly affected the predation cycle of E.
                 sinensis on B. quadrata. These results lay a solid
                 foundation for further studies on the foraging
                 behavioral ecology of E. sinensis and provide important
                 information for improving E. sinensis production.",

  abstract =     "The pelagic stingray (\bioname{Pteroplatytrygon
                 violacea}), perhaps the only stingray to inhabit open
                 ocean waters, is highly interactive with longline and
                 purse seine fisheries. The threat to \bioname{P.
                 violacea} posed by high bycatch mortality has received
                 widespread attention. To date, the environmental
                 preference of \bioname{P. violacea}, which is important
                 in designing conservation and management measures, has
                 not been well studied. Based on data collected during a
                 2016--2019 survey in the Pacific Ocean by national
                 observers of tuna longline fisheries, the relationship
                 between the presence of \bioname{P. violacea} and
                 spatiotemporal and environmental variables was first
                 analyzed using the Generalized Additive Model. The
                 results showed that geographic location (latitude and
                 longitude) was the most influential variable. Monthly,
                 \bioname{P. violacea} is frequently present in the
                 Pacific high sea from December to May. The El
                 Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation had a significant impact
                 on the presence of \bioname{P. violacea} in the Pacific
                 high sea, with both the cold (Ocean Nino Index $ < -
                 0.5$) and warm (Ocean Nino Index $ > 1 $) phases
                 leading to a decrease in its presence. Regarding the
                 environmental factors, we found that high presence was
                 associated with low salinity (33.0 $ \approx $ 34.5
                 psu), a relatively high concentration of chlorophyll
                 (0.2 -- 0.35 m g / m 3), and warm water ($ > 20^\circ
                 $C). \bioname {P. violacea} was most likely observed in
                 the waters offshore, closer to seamounts, and with
                 water depths between 4000 and 5000 m. Four areas,
                 including those east of the Solomon Islands and east of
                 Kiribati, areas west of the Galapagos Islands, and
                 areas near the coastal upwelling of northern Peru,
                 related to upwelling systems or seamounts, were
                 identified as the potential key habitats of \bioname
                 {P. violacea}. Predicted distribution maps showed a
                 significant seasonal variation in the presence of
                 \bioname {P. violacea}. Moreover, the yearly change in
                 the presence of \bioname {P. violacea} in the Pacific
                 high sea indicated a possible decreasing trend in
                 recent years. The information first provided here is
                 essential for developing conservation and management
                 measures for \bioname {P. violacea} to prevent the
                 unavoidable ecological consequences of bycatch or other
                 anthropogenic factors.",

                 physiology of Chinese sturgeon were compared during one
                 year of indoor culture. In terms of specific growth
                 rate, the formulated diet group showed a higher value
                 (4.2\%) compared with the natural food group

  abstract =     "Alterations to the functions and connectivity of
                 mangrove--seagrass--patch reef (MSP) seascapes have the
                 potential to impact the survival, foraging activities,
                 and movement of reef-dependent invertebrates (e.g.,
                 crabs and shrimp) and fishes. In the current study, we
                 examined carbon flow in the Gu{\'a}nica Biosphere
                 Reserve in southwestern Puerto Rico using pigment
                 analysis of particulate organic matter and stable
                 isotope analysis of carbon ({\delta} 13 C) and nitrogen
                 ({\delta} 15 N) in flora and fauna. Several lines of
                 evidence pointed to N 2 fixers (cyanobacteria) being
                 important for fueling primary productivity in this
                 oligotrophic ecosystem including low ({$<$0}.7 $ \mu $
                 g L {$-$1}) chlorophyll, prevalence of cyanobacteria
                 based on pigment signatures, and the isotope signatures
                 of seagrass and red mangrove leaf tissue (enriched
                 {\delta} 15 N values) and consumers (depleted {\delta}
                 15 N values). Food web mixing models based on stable
                 isotopes ({\delta} 13 C and {\delta} 15 N) revealed
                 that multiple producers (phytoplankton, benthic
                 microalgae, seagrasses, etc.) contributed organic
                 matter to the consumers (zooplankton, invertebrates,
                 and fishes) in the MSP seascape at the center of the
                 reserve. Contribution estimates for common benthic
                 invertebrates (crabs and shrimp) were taxon-specific,
                 and the highest input was generally linked to
                 particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae
                 (BMA)/seagrass producer categories, although meaningful
                 mangrove contribution was observed for some taxa.
                 Similarly, contribution estimates for fishes were
                 highest for POM and BMA/seagrass, with the latter
                 producer category being more important for species
                 known to migrate from mangroves or patch reefs to
                 seagrass beds at night (bluestriped grunt, French
                 grunt, and white grunt). Although all fish investigated
                 were observed in mangrove prop-root habitats, input of
                 organic matter from mangroves to these consumers was
                 typically limited for most of the species examined.
                 Understanding these complex seascapes contributes to
                 our understanding of the ecology of these vital
                 ecosystems.",

                 with this anaesthetic for mitochondrial respiration are
                 yet to be established. This is important to evaluate,
                 as an increasing amount of research is conducting
                 high-resolution respirometry to measure respiration
                 across multiple species of fish, including looking at
                 thermal sensitivity and mitochondrial responses to the
                 warmer temperatures faced with climate change. Analysis
                 often occurs after euthanasia with MS-222 without
                 knowledge of how MS-222 itself affects any measured
                 parameters of mitochondrial respiration, leaving
                 potential for a misinterpretation of results. Here,
                 high-resolution respirometry was conducted to explore
                 how MS-222 affects oxidative phosphorylation in the
                 brain and skeletal muscle of the three-spined
                 stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, which is a model
                 species in evolutionary ecology. In the brain,
                 differences in respiration were observed between
                 three-spined sticklebacks euthanised with MS-222 and
                 those where no anaesthetic was implemented. No
                 differences between treatments were observed in the
                 skeletal muscle, although variation between individuals
                 was high and oxygen flux was lower than in the brain.
                 Overall, this study highlights the need for a
                 consistent method of euthanasia when conducting
                 high-resolution respirometry in fish, as MS-222 may
                 alter measures of oxidative phosphorylation.",

  abstract =     "Aquatic surveys for fish in large water bodies (e.g.,
                 Laurentian Great Lakes of North America) often require
                 a flexible approach using multiple methods, surveying
                 different depths, and sampling across seasons,
                 especially when the target species is elusive in its
                 natural habitat. The round goby (\bioname{Neogobius
                 melanostomus}) is an invasive, bottom-dwelling fish
                 inhabiting rocky areas of all five Great Lakes. While
                 trawl surveys are typically used for abundance
                 assessments, angling has been demonstrated as a means
                 of supplementing surveys with additional data. Yet,
                 round goby abundance and distribution is still not well
                 described. Recently, with considerable success,
                 scientists have explored sampling environmental DNA
                 (eDNA) to complement traditional monitoring techniques
                 for population abundance estimates, early detection of
                 invasive species, and spawning or migration events.
                 Therefore, we collected eDNA from water samples
                 alongside bottom trawls and hook and line angling in
                 Lakes Huron and Michigan to detect round goby. eDNA
                 samples were analyzed by both droplet digital PCR
                 (ddPCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to maximize the
                 likelihood of detection. Overall, round goby was
                 captured in 23\% of the trawls, but the eDNA based
                 methods detected round goby in 74\% and 66\% of samples
                 by ddPCR and qPCR, respectively, mostly in samples
                 collected at {$<$30} m depths, and mostly in the fall.
                 More studies comparing eDNA based methods to
                 traditional monitoring, especially trawls in large open
                 waters, may contribute to a better understanding of
                 using eDNA in population assessments.",

                 has been investigated in humans and mammals; in recent
                 years, some researchers have focused on this receptor
                 in fishes. The present study aimed to identify TRPV1
                 receptors in cultures of RT-gill W1 cells and in the
                 organs of rainbow trout (\bioname{Oncorhynchus

                 modulation induced by super critical fluid extract of
                 basil (\bioname{Ocimum basilicum}), named F1-BEO. In
                 vitro evaluation consisted of cell cultures and
                 immunocytochemistry assays. During in vivo experimental
                 sessions, eighty trout were divided into five groups
                 that received a fish diet supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1,
                 2 and 3\% w / w F1-BEO. Forty trout were euthanized
                 after 15 and 30 days; organs were collected and
                 processed according to the immunohistochemistry
                 technique. Receptor expression was quantitatively
                 measured using Image Pro Plus software. TRPV1 was
                 identified in RT-gill W1 cells and in all organs, with
                 a higher positivity in the muscle layers of the
                 stomach, intestine and kidneys. F1-BEO induced an
                 increased expression of TRPV1 in the stomach while a
                 lower expression was appreciated in the bowel. No
                 morphological alterations have been highlighted in the
                 liver or kidneys. Further investigation will be
                 necessary to evaluate the functionality of this

                 inducers in laboratory-conditioned and unconditioned
                 adults of the yellow clam (\bioname{Amarilladesma

                 were laboratory-conditioned for 14 days and exposed to
                 thermal shocks (from 20 {$^\circ $}C to 23--29 {$^\circ
                 $}C), while clams from three additional trials were not
                 conditioned but acclimatized for 45 min before spawning
                 induction. Although conditioning advanced gonad

                 first trials. Histological analysis indicated that the

                 development at the time of capture in the wild, a
                 period longer than 14 days may be necessary.",

                 the disputed maritime areas causes significant damage
                 to the marine ecology and authorized fisheries,
                 increases the risk of conflicts among disputed states,
                 and violates human rights at sea. Both unilateral
                 measures and cooperative governance for IUU fishing are
                 often inadequate in these areas. In light, this study
                 aims to clarify the regulatory obligations of relevant

                 international cooperation to promote IUU governance in
                 disputed areas worldwide. The rapidly evolving
                 international fisheries legal framework requires that
                 states, such as coastal states, flag states, port
                 states, or market states, fulfill their respective
                 obligations to prevent and deter IUU and that the
                 presence of disputes in a specific maritime area does
                 not typically constitute grounds for derogation from
                 these obligations or exemption from possible state
                 responsibility. However, the implications of the
                 conflicting claims in disputed maritime areas should be
                 taken into consideration while interpreting and
                 applying international legal rules. Therefore, this
                 study suggests that regional and inter-regional
                 cooperation is necessary for states to fulfill their
                 obligations to regulate IUU fishing and prevent state
                 responsibilities under international law. Parties to
                 the dispute, as well as third parties, are encouraged
                 to participate in the cooperative mechanism in order to
                 coordinate legislative and enforcement measures and
                 advance the institutionalization of IUU fishing
                 regulation in the disputed maritime areas, which will
                 not only advances the effective governance of IUU

  abstract =     "Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843) is an invasive mussel
                 species that has rapidly spread in China in recent
                 years. Here, we tested the utility of three
                 mitochondrial gene fragments, COI, 12S, and 16S, and
                 two nuclear gene fragments, D1 28S and 18S-ITS1, for
                 characterizing the levels of genetic diversity among
                 and within populations using 191 M. strigata specimens
                 collected in China to aid ongoing efforts to identify
                 the origin of the invasion as well as molecular genetic
                 studies. M. strigata exhibited two sex-associated
                 haplogroups according to the COI and 12S sequences. The
                 ratio of female-lineage to male-lineage COI and 12S
                 sequences was 149:22 and 72:7, and the genetic
                 distances between haplogroups were 6.56 and 9.17,
                 respectively. Only one haplotype was detected among the
                 18S-ITS1 sequences (413 bp), and three haplotypes were
                 detected among the D1 28S sequences (296 bp). The
                 haplotype diversity of both the female-lineage COI and
                 12S sequences was greater than 0.5, and the nucleotide
                 diversity of the 12S, 16S, D1 28S, and 18S-ITS1
                 sequences was less than 0.005 in all six populations in
                 China. Our findings indicated that COI is the most
                 useful gene fragment for genetic diversity studies of
                 M. strigata populations; D1 28S and 18S-ITS1 sequences
                 would be useful for species identification because of
                 their low intraspecific diversity. Our genetic analysis
                 of the COI sequences revealed Colombia as the most
                 likely origin of M. strigata in China and showed that
                 the invasive populations in China have recently
                 experienced or are currently experiencing a population
                 bottleneck.",

  abstract =     "Japanese seabass (\bioname{Lateolabrax japonicus}) is
                 an important species of cultured marine fish with high
                 economic value in China. Nevertheless, from May to
                 November 2019, mass mortality among cultured Japanese
                 seabass occurred in Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province of
                 China. Approximately 0.2--0.5\% mortality was recorded
                 daily, and the cumulative mortality was up to 30\%
                 during this disease outbreak. In this study, the
                 clinical signs and pathological characteristics of
                 diseased fish were investigated. Furthermore, the
                 pathogenicity and antibiotic sensitivity of identified
                 pathogenic bacteria from diseased fish were analyzed.
                 The infected fish showed clinical signs of
                 uncoordinated swimming; anorexia; pigment changes; and
                 a number of 1--5 mm grayish-white nodules in the liver,
                 spleen, and kidney tissues was also found. A bacterial
                 strain, which was designated as ZHLJ2019, was isolated
                 from the diseased fish. To ensure that ZHLJ2019 isolate
                 was the causative agent, a Koch postulate trial was
                 performed. Healthy Japanese seabass were infected by
                 the intraperitoneal injection of 5 $ \times $ 10 4, 5 $
                 \times $ 10 5 and 5 $ \times $ 10 6 CFU/fish, and
                 cumulative mortalities within 42 days were 75\%, 90\%,
                 and 100\%, respectively. The bacteria colony had
                 traditional morphological and biochemical
                 characteristics similar to that of Mycobacterium
                 marinum. Phylogenetic molecular analyses of 16S rRNA,
                 rpoB, hsp65, erp, and ITS genes confirmed that the
                 isolated strain ZHLJ2019 was M. marinum. The
                 granulomatous inflammation in internal organs of
                 Japanese seabass naturally and experimentally infected
                 with ZHLJ2019 isolate was consistent with the classic
                 pathological features of mycobacteriosis. Drug
                 susceptibility of ZHLJ2019 isolate to 11 antibiotics
                 was determined by broth dilution method in vitro. The
                 minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of
                 minocycline, rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid,
                 streptomycin, doxycycline hydrochloride, kanamycin
                 sulfate, levofloxacin, roxithromycin, and prothionamide
                 against the strain ZHLJ2019 were 4, 2, 8, 4, 16, 8, 8,
                 8, 4, and 8 {\mu}g/mL, respectively. The results of
                 this study suggest that M. marinum is the causal agent
                 responsible for the morbidity and mortality of Japanese
                 seabass cultured in intensive brackish water dirt ponds
                 in southern China.",

                 aquaculture species that can ingest organic matter from
                 the surface sediment and shows a high transportation
                 capacity in sediment. However, little is known about
                 the influence of intertidal aquaculture species on the

                 the intestine of S. nudus and three kinds of
                 surrounding sediments were analyzed using
                 high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene
                 amplicon, and the relationships between different
                 communities were examined. Principal coordinate
                 analysis and ANOSIM/Adonis analysis showed that the
                 microbial communities of worm intestine samples were
                 significantly different from those of surrounding
                 sediments ($ p < 0.05$). Meanwhile, compared with the
                 sediment samples, the microbial {\alpha}-diversity was
                 significantly lower in the intestinal samples. Although
                 the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and
                 Cyanobacteria were high in all samples, three phyla
                 (Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Latescibacteria)
                 showed a great difference between the four groups, as
                 the abundances of the three phyla were significantly
                 lower in the intestinal samples. Moreover, several
                 microbial interactions were found between the worm
                 intestine and surrounding sediments. BugBase functional
                 prediction analysis indicated that the oxygen status of
                 the sediment and the intestine was changed by
                 bioturbation by the worm. Therefore, the
                 microenvironment and microbial community in sediment
                 were affected by the activity of S. nudus in the

  abstract =     "The Subtropical Front (STF) plays a key role in the
                 ecology of Chilean jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi.
                 Nonetheless, there are few remote sensing studies of
                 the STF in the open Southeast Pacific, and almost all
                 of them have been conducted by satellite oceanographers
                 in Russia and Ukraine to support respective large-scale
                 fisheries of jack mackerel in this region. We reviewed
                 these studies that documented long-term seasonal and
                 interannual variability of the STF from sea surface
                 temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) data. We
                 also mapped the STF from satellite sea surface salinity
                 (SSS) data of the SMOS mission (2012--2019). The
                 Subtropical Front consists of two fronts--North and
                 South STF about 500 km apart--that border the
                 Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ) in-between. The STF is
                 density-compensated, with spatially divergent
                 manifestations in temperature and salinity. In the
                 temperature field, the STF extends in the WNW to ESE
                 direction in the Southeast Pacific. In the salinity
                 field, the STFZ appears as a broad frontal zone,
                 extending zonally across the entire South Pacific.
                 Three major types of satellite data-SST, SSH, and
                 SSS-can be used to locate the STF. The SSH data is most
                 advantageous with regard to the jack mackerel
                 fisheries, owing to the all-weather capability of
                 satellite altimetry and the radical improvement of the
                 spatial resolution of SSH data in the near future.
                 Despite the dearth of dedicated in situ studies of the
                 South Pacific STFZ, there is a broad consensus
                 regarding the STFZ being the principal spawning and

                 physiological attributes such as tissue-energy

                 widely commercially cultured fish in eastern and
                 southern Asia that possess potential economic value.
                 However, up to date, there are no studies reported on
                 the selection of suitable reference genes in this fish,
                 which is crucial for guaranteeing accurate and reliable
                 results in RT-qPCR analyses. This study aimed at
                 screening the most stable reference genes in the ovary
                 and pituitary at different ovarian stages, which is of
                 great significance for further research on the
                 reproductive regulation mechanism of female S. argus.
                 In this study, we selected twenty-one genes as the
                 candidate reference genes, including four genes in the
                 ovary (EEF1A, ACTB, B2M, and HPRT1), and seventeen
                 genes in the pituitary (B2M, APOA1, CGBA, RPLP0, GNRHR,
                 GUSB, TBP, SLC25A5, RPL4, PLA1A, GAPDH, GNB2L1, CTFS,
                 HPRT1, RPS2, TFRC, and TUBB4B). To analyze the
                 stability of the potential reference genes, we first
                 used four commonly used software, BestKeeper, GeNorm,
                 NormFinder, and {\Delta}Ct, and then we established
                 comprehensive rankings with ReFinder. The results
                 indicate that RPL4 and GNB2L1, and EEF1A and HPRT1 were
                 the most appropriate reference genes for the pituitary
                 and ovary of S. argus, respectively, in the three
                 developmental stages of the ovary. Additionally, GeNorm
                 analysis suggested that for the accurate normalization
                 of gene expression, two reference genes were reliable
                 in the ovary and pituitary of S. argus. To the best of
                 our knowledge and understanding, this is the first
                 study to identify appropriate reference genes for
                 analyzing gene expression in S. argus. Consequently,
                 this study can be used as a foundation for future
                 research on the reproduction of S. argus.",

                 Common practice is that morphometric and molecular
                 studies lack habitat assessments of species originating
                 from different environments. In this study, we analysed
                 body shape and colour variation within two species of
                 Sabanejewia in order to reveal whether they are more
                 affected by phylogeny or environmental conditions. The
                 environmental parameters were obtained using satellite
                 mapping tools, body shape using geometric morphometry,
                 and the molecular identification of specimens using an

                 Results show a significant impact of the locality
                 elevation and specimen's sex on the change of the body
                 shape. We identified significant differences in the
                 number of lateral spots, which are considered mimicry

                 organisms in developmental biology. Cis-regulatory
                 elements (enhancers) control development and physiology
                 by regulating gene expression. Mutations that affect
                 the function of these sequences may contribute to
                 phenotypic diversity. Cis-regulatory targets offer new
                 breeding potential for the future. Here, we use the
                 CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt an enhancer of Endo16 in
                 developing Lytechinus variegatu s embryos, in
                 consideration of the thorough research on Endo16' s

                 plate and archenteron, specifically) and discovered
                 that Endo16 Module A-disrupted embryos failed to

                 sequencing experiments to verify these results.
                 Although mutations were not found regularly from
                 sequencing affected individuals, we discuss some

                 knowledge on the exploitation and conservation status
                 of stocks. This is challenging for by-catch species,
                 for which necessary data for their assessment is more
                 limited than for target ones. That is the case for the
                 thornback ray, Raja clavata, in the Balearic Islands
                 (western Mediterranean), whose exploitation and
                 conservation status are addressed here for the first
                 time, in an integrative approach, by using innovative
                 assessment methods and genetic diversity analysis. The
                 time series of fishing landings from 1964 and MEDITS
                 trawl survey data from 2004 were used to apply CMSY++
                 and Bayesian state-space Schaefer production models. We
                 also estimated the genetic diversity of the Cytochrome
                 C Oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene from 31
                 individuals collected during MEDITS surveys. The
                 species showed overexploitation with a current fishing
                 mortality (F) below that producing maximum sustainable
                 yield (F MSY), but with a current stock biomass (B)
                 lower than B MSY. Despite the fact that the
                 exploitation status is stable or even has improved in
                 the last decades, the overexploitation period since the
                 late 1970s seems to have reduced levels of genetic
                 diversity, below those of related species and other
                 populations of R. clavata. This low genetic diversity
                 may entail the loss of adaptive potential, making the
                 species more vulnerable to fishing and the current

                 environmental sustainability in the aquaculture
                 industry, but we do not know how firms in this industry
                 emphasize the issue compared to firms in other
                 industries. Methods: Responding to this research gap,
                 we compared survey data of Norwegian firms in the (1)
                 aquaculture industry with those in the (2)
                 manufacturing industry, (3) the consulting, finance and
                 insurance industry, and (4) the hospitality, tourism
                 and culture industry. Results: We found that firms in
                 the aquaculture industry emphasize environmental
                 sustainability more than those in the other industries
                 do. Likewise, firms in the aquaculture industry
                 emphasize social sustainability more than those in the
                 other industries do, but the difference is less marked.
                 Across industries, knowledge-intensive firms emphasize
                 environmental sustainability and social sustainability
                 to a lesser extent. Additionally, firms with local or
                 regional major ownership emphasize social
                 sustainability more than those with international major
                 ownership do. Conclusion: Firms in the aquaculture
                 industry have a relatively strong emphasis on
                 environmental and social sustainability, which may be
                 due to the industry's environmental challenges.
                 Similarly, aquaculture firms have a relatively strong
                 emphasis on social sustainability, which may be due to
                 the industry's geographic and sociocultural proximity
                 to numerous small local communities.",

                 and their expression in various organs after pathogen

                 association domain, and viral-activated domain were
                 found to be highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis
                 revealed that PmIRF5 and PmIRF6 were most closely
                 related to IRF5 and IRF6 of large yellow croakers. The

  abstract =     "The primary goal in aquaculture is to maximize the
                 growth and survival of farmed fishes at a minimal cost,
                 which requires an understanding of the changes in
                 metabolism undergone by different fish breeds during
                 development. In particular, highly intensive
                 aquaculture production systems, such as recirculating
                 aquaculture systems, require a better understanding of
                 oxygen consumption. Ontogenetic phase shifts (i.e.,
                 sudden changes) in metabolism have been observed in
                 several aquaculture species during early development,
                 and such metabolic phase shifts may help to predict the
                 oxygen consumption of aquaculture species during
                 different stages of their development. Here, I analyzed
                 the pattern of metabolic changes in the F 2 hybrid
                 sturgeon, the bester (Huso huso $ \times $ Acipenser
                 ruthenus; hereafter, referred to as the F 2 bester),
                 during its early development. I observed ontogenetic
                 phase shifts in metabolism in the F 2 bester at body
                 mass values of about 0.2 and 0.8 g. Thus, the F 2
                 bester undergoes ontogenetic phase shifts in metabolism
                 during early development, which can help to
                 characterize oxygen consumption at a specific
                 developmental period. Therefore, oxygen can be
                 appropriately adjusted and replenished during

                 alexandri larvae of different ages. In the first phase,
                 Artemia nauplii were marked 28 h after hatching with
                 chromium oxide, titanium dioxide and NANOLIPE {\reg}.
                 Contact times with the markers were 30, 60, 90 min at a
                 concentration of 500 mg/L. Titanium dioxide had a
                 higher concentration in Artemia than the other markers.
                 The passage rate did not differ significantly between
                 titanium and NANOLIPE {\reg}. In the second phase, the
                 apparent digestibility of the protein in Artemia
                 nauplii was evaluated for L. alexandri larvae at three

                 as increased the loss of total sulfhydryl (SH) groups
                 (p {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, transmission electron
                 microscope (TEM) images illustrated that the
                 microstructure of muscle fibers was loosed and
                 disintegrated after the third F--T cycle, causing a
                 reduction in water holding capacity (WHC). In addition,
                 muscles lost the intrinsic color of fresh meat after
                 the fifth cycle, with lightness L* and yellowness b*
                 increasing, while redness a* declined (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 The hardness, springiness, and chewiness of muscles
                 decreased, and the shear force first increased and then
                 decreased after the third cycle. Furthermore, the
                 proximate components, essential amino acids (EAAs), and
                 total amino acids (TAAs), decreased significantly after
                 the third cycle (p {$<$} 0.05) due to the decrease of
                 WHC as well as protein and lipid oxidation. The results
                 indicated that the quality of rainbow trout muscle
                 changed after the third cycle, deteriorated seriously
                 after the fifth cycle, and was unacceptable after the
                 seventh cycle. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the
                 temperature fluctuation to less than three times during
                 freezing. The results provided a reference for the
                 identification and classification of frozen aquatic
                 products.",

                 for small molecules that help in regulating homeostasis
                 in fishes when adapting to changing environments, but
                 its role in Amur ide's response to alkaline stress is
                 yet to be revealed. Therefore, the purpose of this
                 study is to investigate the response of the Aqp gene
                 exposed to alkaline water in Amur ide (Leuciscus
                 waleckii) using a genome-transcriptional assay. Based
                 on the results, we classified the Aqps of the L.
                 waleckii (LwAqps) genome and analyzed its
                 transcriptional expression profile and genetic
                 evolution under carbonate alkalinity stress. A total of
                 18 Aqp genes were identified in four grades in L.
                 waleckii. The highest Aqp gene expression was found in
                 the gill and kidney of L. waleckii from the Wusuli
                 River (WSL) in comparison to those in the Dali Lake
                 (DL), whereas aqp3a, -3ap1, -7, and -9a expressions
                 were found at intensively higher levels in the gill
                 rather than in the kidneys and livers. The experiment
                 of L. waleckii under alkalinity stress (carbonate
                 alkalinity 50 mmol{\cdot}L {-1}) and its recovery
                 showed that the expressions of aqp0a, -3a, -3ap1, -7,
                 -8aa, and -9a were upregulated in alkaline water and
                 downregulated in freshwater. We identified 1460 single
                 nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the Aqp genes.
                 The average value of Fst of SNP markers in the CDS
                 region was 0.177 {\pm} 0.256, and the first 5\% SNPs
                 were identified at aqp3a and -11b. Residue Ser66 does
                 not bring about an overall change in the
                 three-dimensional structure of Aqp3a, but may change
                 the penetration of solutes across the membrane. This
                 indicates that Aqp genes are involved in the response
                 of L. waleckii to alkaline stress, and aqp3a is one of
                 the key genes involved in regulating L. waleckii 's
                 adaptation to alkaline environments.",

                 the reproductive biology of Pseudecheneis sulcatus
                 (McClelland, 1842) found in the Yarlung Zangbo Grand
                 Canyon, a biodiversity hotspot. Reproductive
                 characteristics of Pseudecheneis sulcatus, including
                 their maturation age, fertility, spawning season, and
                 maximum body size, constitute important aspects of its
                 life-history traits. We collected a total of 310
                 specimens from the Yarlung Zangbo River's Motuo reach
                 between March and November 2016 and found the
                 male-to-female ratio to be 0.73:1, markedly different
                 from the anticipated 1:1. The total length of
                 individuals ranged from 72 to 207 mm, while overall
                 weight ranged from 2.5 to 65.0 g. Their length at first
                 maturity was estimated as 131 mm in males and 132 mm in
                 females. Based on the adult proportion and fluctuation
                 in the monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI) and size
                 distribution of oocytes, spawning was determined to
                 occur from March to June. The absolute fecundity ranged
                 between 247 and 2886 eggs, while the fluctuation in
                 average relative fertility ranged between 16.8 and 77.1
                 eggs/g of fish. The fecundity of P. sulcatus was
                 linearly correlated to the overall weight and length of
                 the fish along with the ovarian weight. In conclusion,
                 P. sulcatus spawned synchronously in spring and early
                 summer, exhibiting low fecundity and large oocytes. Our
                 results provided basic information in understanding how
                 this species adapted well to the unique canyon
                 environment, which may be useful for developing a
                 sustainable conservation plan for P. sulcatus at the

                 Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was
                 investigated. Four diets (iso-energetic and
                 iso-nitrogenous) with different levels of {\beta}-1,3
                 GF (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g kg {-1}) were fed to healthy
                 shrimp juveniles weighing 3 {\pm} 0.5 g for 75 days.
                 Shrimps were randomly distributed into 12 net
                 enclosures at a density of 30 shrimp/net, and the
                 experiment was performed in triplicate. The results
                 revealed that long-term supplementation with 1.5 g kg
                 {-1} {\beta}-1,3 GF significantly improved shrimp
                 weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and digestive
                 enzyme profiles compared to the control diet group.
                 However, there were no substantial variations in the
                 contents of moisture, crude protein, total lipids, and
                 ash in the muscles of shrimp fed on different diets.
                 Surprisingly, all antioxidants (superoxide dismutase,
                 catalase, glutathione peroxidase) and immune biomarkers
                 (lysozyme, total hemocyte count, phenol oxidase, and
                 respiratory burst) activities were significantly
                 elevated with increasing levels of {\beta}-1,3 GF in
                 the shrimp diet, and the highest values were recorded
                 in the 1.5 g kg {-1} diet groups. Challenge test
                 results revealed that F. solani could cause a high
                 mortality rate (86.7\%) in a group fed a normal basal
                 diet within 14 days at a dose of 5 $ \times $ 10 4
                 conidia mL {-1}. Surprisingly, all dietary treated
                 groups with different doses of {\beta}-1,3 GF showed
                 high resistance against F. solani, represented by lower
                 cumulative mortality rates (20--43.3\%) compared to the
                 control group. Moreover, most of the infected shrimp
                 showed a typical black to brown gill lesion similar to
                 that observed in the natural infection, where an
                 identical fungus was successfully re-isolated from
                 infected gills and muscles. Overall, this study
                 recommends an appropriate incorporation level of
                 {\beta}-1,3 GF that could enhance growth performance
                 and improve the antioxidant activities, non-specific
                 immunity, and disease resistance of L. vannamei, with
                 an optimal level of 1.5 g kg {-1}.",

                 sustainable food, playing a key role in achieving
                 nutrition security, employment, and Blue Growth. This
                 is particularly true in geographical areas where the
                 dependence of local economies on fishery products is
                 high and yet access to sustainable landings is hindered
                 by environmental drawbacks. One such area is
                 represented by the Black Sea, which offers different
                 degrees of suitability for aquaculture development.
                 While the southern and eastern shores are sheltered
                 enough to allow for the development of large
                 aquaculture activities, the north-western shoreline is
                 characterized by wide environmental fluctuations and
                 the strong influence of the Danube. This study aimed at
                 investigating the suitability of a selected area of the
                 Romanian coast (Mangalia) for finfish cage farming by
                 adapting an internationally endorsed methodology for
                 determining its Degree of Compatibility (DC). The
                 development and expansion of finfish aquaculture
                 depends on the availability of space, so designating
                 Allocated Zones for Aquaculture (AZAs) is essential.
                 The result obtained (DC = 80) indicates that the
                 Mangalia area is suitable for finfish aquaculture
                 activities: there is no major interference with other
                 uses of the maritime space, no conflicts with nature
                 conservation, and the environmental conditions are
                 appropriate for fish culture in floating cages. The
                 novel information provided by this study can be the
                 building block for authorities to settle the governance
                 gap that has so far impeded the development of marine
                 aquaculture in Romania. At a larger scale, this study

                 significantly different among the treatments. At 456
                 days post-initial feeding, individual fish were
                 significantly longer and heavier in the 20 mg/kg
                 estradiol treatment compared to the fish in the control
                 treatment, and the fish in the 30 mg/kg estradiol
                 treatment were similar to the other two treatments.
                 This study is the first to document the successful sex
                 reversal of brown trout using estradiol. While the
                 estradiol treatments used in this study did not lead to
                 complete feminization, the observed 85-to-15\%
                 female-to-male phenotypic ratio indicates the
                 successful feminization of genetic males. The levels of
                 feminization observed in this study are suitable for
                 this initial step to potentially develop a YY male
                 broodstock to control invasive brown trout

                 of environmental pollution on marine and fresh waters
                 is a promising tool due to a lower cost in comparison
                 to traditional monitoring and the ability to receive
                 immediate information about the ecosystem status. In
                 this review, we summarize the biological information
                 about shellfish biomonitors and the results of studies
                 focused on the development and use of the bioindicator
                 species in early warning systems in Russia. Since the
                 mid-1980s, Russian specialists have developed online
                 biomonitoring systems; as in the rest of world, there
                 are two main approaches that are currently applied to
                 study the physiological status of potential biosensor
                 shellfish species and to monitor freshwater and marine
                 systems: valvometry (registration of gaping activity in
                 bivalve mollusks) and photoplethysmography
                 (registration of cardiac activity in mollusks and
                 crustaceans). Valve movement responses to stressors
                 such as abnormal conditions and pollutants include the
                 closure of shell valves for a long period, decrease in
                 the average distance between valves, rapid shell
                 opening, and higher closing frequency. Cardiac activity
                 reactions of shellfish to stress factors include rapid
                 increases in heart rate and stress index, higher
                 variability in heart rate than under normal conditions,
                 and longer periods required for heart rate recovery
                 after stress. The most common bioindicators used to
                 monitor environmental disturbances in marine ecosystems
                 are blue mussels, Iceland scallops, and red king crabs
                 in cold-water habitats and Black Sea mussels in warmer

                 reducing concentrations of bacteria and other harmful
                 suspended organisms, but it remains unknown if
                 microphagous suspension-feeding fishes can provide
                 similar ecosystem services for water quality. Here, we

                 (Entosphenus tridentatus) can reduce suspended

                 containing either filter-feeding ammocoete lamprey
                 larvae (1.5 fish{\cdot}L {-1}), lamprey macropthalmia
                 juveniles (1.5 fish{\cdot}L {-1}) that do not
                 suspension-feed, or no lamprey (control) were filled

                 monitored for 5 d for E. coli concentration changes in
                 the water column. The presence of ammocoete larvae
                 generated a significantly faster decline in E. coli
                 abundance compared to aquaria containing either
                 macropthalmia-stage lamprey or no fish, which showed
                 similar E. coli concentration profiles over that 5 d
                 period. A higher density of ammocoetes (4.3
                 fish{\cdot}L {-1}) resulted in a more rapid decline in
                 E. coli compared to the lower 1.5 fish{\cdot}L {-1}
                 ammocoete density, further implying that ammocoetes
                 augmented bacterial clearance. These observations
                 provide evidence that filter-feeding larval ammocoetes
                 of Pacific lamprey may help promote water-quality

                 leading factors affecting marine fish populations.
                 Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), characterized as the sea
                 surface temperature (SST) anomaly change, is an
                 ocean--atmosphere interactive process causing
                 interannual climate variability in the Indian Ocean.
                 Influences of the IOD on the tuna catch rates are
                 supported by previous research. Yet, there remains
                 limited information about the impacts on the abundance
                 of tuna stocks. In this study, we used the standardized
                 Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) index to present the stock
                 abundance and compared the effects of the IOD on the
                 bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna
                 (Thunnus albacares) among different management areas of

                 Ocean. However, in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean
                 and the southern Indian Ocean, neither bigeye nor
                 yellowfin tuna abundances were significantly correlated
                 by the IOD. For the whole Indian Ocean, IOD was
                 significantly correlated uniquely with the yellowfin
                 tuna abundance. Our results emphasized the importance
                 of evaluating the climate variability effects over

                 improvement activities in crab culture on nutrients and
                 heavy metals and the response of bacterial communities
                 to the relevant changes are unclear. In this study, 24
                 water and sediment samples were collected from two
                 aquaculture sites (total of 12 ponds, 6 at each site).
                 High-throughput sequencing was used to determine the
                 structure of the bacterial community and the diversity
                 in water and sediment samples. The relationship between
                 nutrients, heavy metals, and bacterial communities and
                 the changes of the three before and after the
                 improvement of the sediment were analyzed. The results
                 showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
                 Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes were
                 predominant at the phylum level of sediment. Sediment
                 improvement has an effect on NH 4 + -N, sulfide, total
                 organic carbon (TOC), and heavy metals in sediments to
                 varying degrees. In addition, redundancy analysis found
                 that NH 4 + -N, NO 3 {-} -N, TP, and heavy metals were
                 key drivers in crab culture pond sediments. The results

                 and sulfur metabolism were the dominant processes in
                 the two crab farming areas. Overall, changes in
                 nutrients and heavy metals caused by sediment
                 improvement further affected the structure and function
                 of bacterial communities and may affect biogeochemical
                 cycles. Our study has deepened the understanding of the

                 were 63 m 3, and 45 m 3 in ponds 3 and 4 (RW3/RW4).
                 Each pond had one (14 m 3) stocker unit raceway and a 5
                 HP of aeration that maintained adequate dissolved
                 oxygen levels. Average growout production was 12,050
                 kg/ha in 63 m 3 raceways and 12,078 kg/ha in 45 m 3
                 raceways (228 days of production) and achieved harvest
                 weights ranging from 564 to 661 g. The raceway stocker
                 unit had production yields ranging from 3537 to 4388
                 kg/ha (143 days of production) and achieved harvest
                 weights ranging from 123 to 234 g. Stocker units in
                 ponds 1 and 2 generated 8540 stocker--fingerlings
                 (21,102 fingerlings/ha) and units in ponds 3 and 4
                 generated 7954 fingerlings (19,654 fingerlings/ha). An
                 investment of USD 39,996 was needed for ponds 1 and 2
                 and USD 21,196 for ponds 3 and 4. When scenarios were
                 analyzed financially, positive financial net returns
                 occurred when farm level investment decreased, leading
                 to reduced payback periods, increased net present
                 values, and higher internal rates of return. IPRS used
                 stocker units to culture fingerlings for future
                 stocking of foodsize fish. IPRS provided good inventory
                 control, and high production yields compared to
                 traditional pond culture of catfish.",

                 from the other two species were seen along the dorsal
                 margin of the otoliths, which was supported by its
                 significantly higher values for OH (size-related index)
                 and RO (shape-related index). In addition, the
                 morphometric indices showed significant variations (p

                 separate D. kurroides from the other two species, which
                 turned out to be indifferent. The results provided

                 the molecular mechanism of gonadal development in
                 Macrobrachium rosenbergii, a comparative transcriptome
                 analysis was performed on the testes and ovaries at
                 different developmental stages. A total of 146,537
                 unigenes with an N50 of 2008 bp and an average length
                 of 1144 bp were obtained from the sequencing raw data
                 via quality control and denovo assembly. Identification
                 of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that
                 there were 339 and 468 DEGs among the different
                 developmental stages of testes and ovaries,
                 respectively, and 7993 DEGs between the testes and
                 ovaries. The KEGG enrichment analysis identified 13
                 candidate pathways related to gonadal development,
                 including insulin synthesis, oocyte maturation, and
                 steroid biosynthesis, which were involved in biological
                 processes such as regulation of hormone metabolism, sex
                 cell proliferation and development, and amino acid
                 metabolism. The DEGs related to the above pathways such
                 as insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), heat
                 shock protein 90 (Hsp 90), and cyclooxygenase (COX)
                 genes were highly expressed during yolk protein
                 synthesis, indicating that these genes might be
                 involved in yolk accumulation and oogenesis. Meanwhile,
                 calmodulin (CaM) and other genes were highly expressed
                 during spermatogenesis, suggesting that these genes
                 might play an important role in spermatogenesis. Ten
                 differentially expressed genes in the KEGG signaling
                 pathway, including CRQ, COX, APP, Cdc42, Hsd17b12,
                 Art-1, Hsp70, Hsp90, PRMT1, and GP, were selected for
                 real-time quantitative PCR (RT- qPCR) to validate the
                 transcriptome data, and the results showed that RT-
                 qPCR obtained consistent results with the RNA-Seq data.

                 responsible for hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis, is a
                 major pathogen in commercial shrimp production. Among
                 the affected species, Palaemon carinicauda (formerly
                 Exopalaemon carinicauda) is commercially important in
                 China and represents a potential research model for

                 protein sources to replace traditional fisheries and
                 plant ingredients. Using agriculture by-products as
                 protein sources would reduce land-based feed production
                 pressure and waste production, promoting a circular
                 economy and sustainable aquaculture. Distiller's dried
                 grains with solubles (DDGS) is the main by-product of
                 bioethanol production. Corn DDGS has a high protein
                 level, but its high fiber content limits its use as a
                 feed ingredient, particularly for carnivorous fish.
                 Solid-state fermentation (SSF) uses
                 lignocellulosic-rich substrates, such as DDGS, for
                 microbial growth in the near absence of water,
                 promoting enzyme production that degrades the
                 lignocellulosic matrix, increasing free reducing
                 sugars, protein, and antioxidant levels of the
                 substrate. In the present work, the SSF of corn DDGS
                 with Aspergillus carbonarius, A. ibericus, and A.
                 uvarum was tested. Then, the digestibility of the most
                 promising fermented DDGS (in terms of upgraded
                 nutritional composition) was tested by including it in
                 a reference diet (70\% of a reference diet; 48\% crude
                 protein; 15\% crude lipids) for European seabass
                 (Dicentrarchus labrax) juveniles (171 g averaged
                 weight; trial duration of 52 days). Among the fungi
                 tested, Aspergillus ibericus led a generally higher
                 upgrading of the DDGS nutritional composition, leading
                 to a high amount of protein (from 42.7 to 49.7 g N/kg
                 DM), phenolic compounds (1.49 to 4.86 mg/g caffeic acid
                 equivalents), free sugars (9.5 to 31.9 mg/g), and
                 enzyme production (45 U/g and 68 U/g of cellulase and
                 xylanase, respectively), and a high reduction in acid
                 detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber content (up
                 to 29 and 43\%, respectively). Compared to the
                 unfermented DDGS, fermented DDGS presented increased
                 protein, lipids, starch, and energy digestibility,
                 while phosphorous digestibility was similar. Compared
                 to the reference diet, dietary inclusion of unfermented
                 or fermented DDGS increased trypsin and chymotrypsin
                 activities. The activity of digestive enzymes was not
                 affected by the inclusion of fermented DDGS, except for
                 amylase activity, which was lower with the fermented

                 populations in the coast of China, mitochondrial DNA
                 (COI and Cytb genes) were used to analyze the genetic
                 diversity, genetic structure, and population history
                 dynamics of Mytilus unguiculatus in the East China Sea
                 and the Yellow Sea. We detected high levels of genetic
                 diversity in seven populations of M. unguiculatus. A
                 total of 34 haplotypes of COI genes and 29 haplotypes
                 of Cytb were obtained. The haplotype diversity of COI
                 ranged from around 0.77 to 0.93 (Cytb: 0.83--0.91). The
                 nucleotide diversity of COI ranged from around 0.0044
                 to 0.0064 (Cytb: 0.0049--0.0063). The coefficient of
                 genetic differentiation (F ST) of COI ranged from
                 around 0.031 to 0.080, and Cytb ranged from around
                 0.028 to 0.039. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
                 and a phylogenetic tree showed that the genetic
                 structure was relatively weak, and there was no clear
                 population differentiation. The neutrality test results
                 showed that Tajima's D value and Fu's Fs value were not

                 events, including population expansion or population
                 bottleneck, were detected in the samples. The Bayesian
                 skyline graph analysis showed that the effective
                 population size has been relatively stable for nearly
                 10,000 years, without any large population
                 fluctuations. It was speculated that the seven
                 populations in the present study should belong to the

  abstract =     "Repeated fish handling may cause stress, which biases
                 experiments and so affects the results. In order to
                 reduce this, the present study investigates the benefit
                 of using bioimpedance analysis to estimate
                 morphological parameters. Bioimpedance analysis is a
                 non-lethal and integrative electrical measurement that
                 can be used to estimate several kinds of physiological
                 parameters and is used in medicine and ecological
                 studies. In particular, bioimpedance can monitor the
                 individual growth of fish, which is a prerequisite for
                 most biological and ecological studies, as body size is
                 one of the best predictors for numerous life history
                 traits and ecological parameters. After a short review
                 on the use of bioimpedance measurement in medicine and
                 ecology, we illustrate the potential of bioimpedance
                 spectroscopy, as opposed to single frequency
                 measurement, for experimental studies on fish. Using a
                 monolithic four-contact electrode and a cost-effective
                 portable system, we conducted bioimpedance spectroscopy
                 on 159 sardines. The association between the length,
                 weight, and electrical parameters obtained at different
                 frequencies from the bioimpedance spectroscopy was
                 investigated. Our results show that accounting for more
                 than one frequency substantially improves the
                 prediction of length and weight. We conclude that
                 bioimpedance could potentially be a powerful tool for
                 monitoring fish growth in ecological studies.",

  abstract =     "Bioluminescence is a common ecological trait among
                 many marine organisms, including three shark families:
                 Etmopteridae, Dalatiidae, and Somniosidae. The kitefin
                 shark, Dalatias licha (Bonnaterre, 1788), from the
                 Dalatiidae family is the largest known luminous
                 vertebrate. This study compares the light organ
                 ultrastructure of D. licha with that of Etmopterus
                 spinax, the type species of Etmopteridae, to gain a
                 deeper understanding of the light emission process and
                 its evolutionary conservation within shark families.
                 The ultrastructure of D. licha 's photophores and the
                 morphological changes that occur after hormonal
                 stimulation (via melatonin and \alpha -MSH, which
                 stimulate or inhibit the bioluminescence, respectively)
                 were examined. The photophores consist of a spherical
                 pigmented sheath surrounding a unique, regionalized
                 light-emitting cell (photocyte). The photocyte's basal
                 area contains a specific area filled with granular
                 inclusions that resemble the glowon-type microsources
                 of E. spinax, suggesting that this area is the
                 intracellular site of light emission. An acidophilic
                 secretion, not present in Etmopteridae, is also
                 observed within the granular area and may be involved
                 in photogenesis. The ultrastructure analysis reveals no
                 lens cells or reticular layer, unlike in Etmopteridae
                 photophores, indicating a simpler organization in
                 Dalatiidae photophores. Melatonin stimulation causes
                 the removal of pigments from the photophore-associated
                 melanophores and an increase in the granular inclusion
                 diameter and coverage in the granular area, further
                 showing that this last area is the potential site of
                 light emission, while \alpha -MSH stimulation causes
                 the extension of the melanophore pigments and a
                 decrease in the granular inclusion diameter and
                 coverage. These results support the evolutive
                 conservation of photophore functional organization
                 across luminous etmopterid and dalatiid sharks.",

                 important species and supports important fisheries in
                 the Northwest Pacific Ocean (NPO). Understanding the
                 habitat distribution patterns of Pacific sardine is of
                 great significance for fishing ground prediction and
                 stock management. In this study, both single-algorithm
                 and ensemble distribution models were established
                 through the Biomod2 package for Pacific sardine by
                 combining the species occurrence data, sea surface
                 temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), sea
                 surface salinity (SSS) and chlorophyll-a concentration
                 (Chla) in the NPO during the main fishing season
                 (June--November) from 2015 to 2020. The results
                 indicated that the key environmental variables
                 affecting the habitat distribution of Pacific sardine
                 were the SSH and SST. The suitable habitat area for
                 Pacific sardine showed significant monthly changes: the
                 suitable habitat range in June was larger than that in
                 July and August, while the suitable habitat range
                 gradually increased from September to November.
                 Furthermore, the monthly geometric centers of habitat
                 suitability index (HSI) for Pacific sardine presented a
                 counterclockwise pattern, gradually moving to the
                 northeast from June, and then turning back to the
                 southwest from August. Compared with single-algorithm
                 models, the ensemble model had higher evaluation metric
                 values and better spatial correspondence between
                 habitat prediction and occurrence records data, which
                 indicated that the ensemble model can provide more
                 accurate prediction and is a promising tool for
                 potential habitat forecasting and resource

  abstract =     "Two species of carcharhinid sharks aggregate every
                 winter at the warm water effluent of a coastal power
                 plant on the Israeli Mediterranean coast. The two
                 species (Carcharhinus obscurus and Carcharhinus
                 plumbeus) cooccur in a highly confined area for several
                 months every year and are highly associated with the
                 area in and around the hot water effluent. Niche
                 partitioning has recently been suggested as a mechanism
                 that enables the coexistence of similar shark species
                 by resource partitioning, spatial partitioning, and
                 temporal partitioning. In this study, we used acoustic
                 telemetry to study the individual diel movement and
                 activity patterns within this enclosed area and
                 examined the differences between the two species
                 sharing it. Although this location only reaches a
                 maximum depth of 7.5 m, we found both species perform a
                 diel vertical movement, rising closer to the surface at
                 night and moving deeper during daytime. Furthermore,
                 the two shark species swam at different depths both day
                 and night, with C. obscurus swimming in the upper
                 column, about 2 m shallower than C. plumbeus. The very
                 small scale of movement, which nearly equals the
                 sharks' body length, suggests movement patterns might
                 be conserved at the species level. Moreover,
                 spatiotemporal differences between the two species may
                 reflect a mean of interspecific partitioning that
                 occurs even in a highly confined and shallow habitat.",

                 profiling indicated that B. cereus caused vacuolization
                 and cell necrosis in the liver, spleen, kidney, and
                 intestine. The identification of the virulence factor
                 genes non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe), hemolysin BL
                 (Hbl), and enterotoxin FM (entFM) confirmed bacterial
                 pathogenicity. Splenic transcriptomic sequencing at 96

                 genes mapped to diverse gene families, including
                 interleukin, complement, chemokine, and interferon. The
                 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in

                 cellular components, and 342 in molecular functions.
                 Further KEGG enrichment indicated that DEGs were
                 primarily associated with the phagosome, NF-kappa B
                 signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The

                 (Scorpaena porcus L.) had high ecto-ATPase activity.
                 This activity varied from 3.0 to 3.9 and 6.0 to 10.0
                 nmol Fn/min/$ \mu $L RBC in rays and scorpionfish,
                 respectively. The use of thermal energy of ATP in the
                 hydrolysis process made by ecto-ATPases in fish
                 erythrocytes provided a heating of the plasma cells'
                 membrane and the near-wall plasma layer with an aim to
                 improve the rheological characteristics of blood in the
                 capillary blood flow. To confirm the proposed
                 assumption, we studied thermal phenomena in
                 erythrocytes suspensions of fishes by continuous
                 recording of temperature changes in the experimental
                 cell with fishes' erythrocytes suspension with the
                 addition of ATP (1 mg/mL) in vitro. A higher
                 ``thermal'' activity of scorpionfish erythrocytes was
                 established in comparison with erythrocytes of the

                 activity of suspensions of erythrocytes of thornback

                 thermal energy of ATP hydrolysis by fish erythrocytes,
                 both to maintain the functional state of the plasma

                 operates are the nitrogen cycle (nitrification) and the
                 phosphorus cycle (phosphate). Because some research
                 indicates that aquaponics systems are primarily
                 deficient in phosphorus, phosphate-enriched nutrients
                 were added to raise the phosphorus levels. During an
                 eight-week experimental period, the effects of water

                 growth performance, chlorophyll compounds in lettuce,

  abstract =     "Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) is a major targeted
                 species in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, fished by
                 China, Japan, and Russia, and predominantly captured
                 with purse seine fishing gear. A formal stock
                 assessment of Chub mackerel in the region has yet to be
                 implemented by the managing authority, that is, the
                 North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC). This study
                 aims to provide a wider choice of potential models for
                 the stock assessment of Chub mackerel in the Northwest
                 Pacific using available data provided by members of the
                 NPFC. The five models tested in the present study are
                 CMSY, BSM, SPiCT, JABBA, and JABBA-Select. Furthermore,
                 the influence of different data types and input
                 parameters on the performance of the different models
                 used was evaluated. These effects for each model are
                 catch time series for CMSY, catch time series and prior
                 of the relative biomass for BSM, prior information for
                 SPiCT, and selectivity coefficients for JABBA-Select.
                 Catch and CPUE (catch per unit effort) data used are
                 derived from NPFC, while some life history information
                 is referred from other references. The results indicate
                 that Chub mackerel stock might be slightly overfished,
                 as indicated by CMSY (B 2020 / B MSY = 0.98, F 2020 / F
                 MSY = 1.12), BSM (B 2020 / B MSY = 0.97, F 2020 / F MSY
                 = 1.21), and the base case run for the JABBA-Select (SB
                 2020 / SB MSY = 0.99, H 2020 / H MSY = 0.99) models.
                 The results of the models SPiCT (B 2020 / B MSY = 2.30,
                 F 2020 / F MSY = 0.31) and JABBA (B 2020 / B MSY =
                 1.40, F 2020 / F MSY = 0.62) showed that the state of
                 this stock may be healthy. Changes in the catch time
                 series did not affect CMSY results but did affect BSM.
                 The present study confirms that prior information for
                 BSM and SPiCT models is very important in order to
                 obtain reliable results on the stock status. The
                 results of JABBA-Select showed that different
                 selectivity coefficients can affect the stock status of
                 a species, as observed in the present study. Based on
                 the optimistic stock status indicated by the best
                 model, JABBA, a higher catch is allowable, but further
                 projection is required for specific catch limit
                 setting. Results suggested that, as a precautionary
                 measure, management would be directed towards
                 maintaining or slightly reducing the fishing effort for
                 the sustainable harvest of this fish stock, while
                 laying more emphasis on accurately estimating prior
                 input parameters for use in assessment models.",

                 and weight) of the family at 5 and 17 months after

                 the genetic linkage map constructed in our laboratory.
                 We identified 47 QTL that were related to the four
                 growth traits and three consensus QTL (cQTL). A total
                 of 10, 14, 10, and 13 QTL were associated with body

                 activity is very important for fisheries resource
                 monitoring and spatial management. The environmental
                 preferences of tropical tuna purse seine fleet in the
                 Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) were
                 constructed and compared at different spatial scales
                 based on the fishing effort (FE) data from the
                 available automatic identification system (AIS) and
                 commercial fishery data compiled from the Western and
                 Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), using
                 maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. The MaxEnt models
                 were fitted with FE and commercial fishery data and
                 remote sensing environmental data. Our results showed
                 that the area under the curve (AUC) value each month
                 based on the commercial fishery data (1\degree) and FE
                 at 0.25\degree and 0.5\degree spatial scales was
                 greater than 0.8. The AUC values each month based on
                 the FE data at a 1\degree scale ranged from 0.775 to
                 0.829. The AUC values based on commercial fishing data
                 at the 1\degree scale were comparable to the model
                 results based on FE data at the 0.5\degree scale and
                 inferior to the model results based on FE data at the
                 0.25\degree scales. Overall, the sea surface
                 temperature (SST), temperature at 100 metres (T100),
                 oxygen concentration at 100 metres (O100) and total
                 primary production (PP) had the greatest influence on
                 the distribution of the purse seine tuna fleet. The
                 oxygen concentration at 200 metres (O200), distance to
                 shore (DSH), dissolved oxygen (Dox), EKE, mixed layer
                 depth (Mld), sea surface salinity (SSS), salinity at
                 100 metres (S100) and salinity at 200 metres (S200) had
                 moderate influences, and other environmental variables
                 had little influence. The suitable habitat areas varied
                 in response to environmental conditions. The purse
                 seine tuna fleet was mostly present at locations where
                 the SST, T100, O100, O200 and PP were 28--30 \degree C,
                 27--29 \degree C, 150--200 mmol/m 3 and 5--10 mg/m
                 \minus 3, respectively. The MaxEnt models enable the
                 integration of AIS data and high-resolution

                 describe the spatiotemporal distribution of the tuna

  abstract =     "Chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, is heavily farmed
                 and harvested due to its demand as a high-quality
                 protein source rich in fatty acids. However, the
                 effects of environmental cues on sexual maturation of
                 the fish remain understudied. We aim to elucidate the
                 effect of light manipulation on the hormones related to
                 reproduction and on the stress response in the species.
                 Mackerel were exposed to different photoperiods (12 h
                 light:12 h dark or 14 h light:10 h dark) and light
                 wavelengths (provided by white fluorescent bulbs or
                 green LEDs). Total RNA extracted from the brain was
                 assayed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (a
                 powerful technique for advancing functional genomics)
                 and blood plasma was analyzed via immunoassay using
                 ELISA kits. The mRNA expression of gene-encoding
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin hormone,
                 follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone
                 were significantly increased through the use of an
                 extended photoperiod and green wavelength, which also
                 increased testosterone and 17\beta -estradiol plasma
                 levels. Plasma levels of cortisol and glucose, which
                 are indicators of a stress response, were significantly
                 decreased through green LED exposure. Our results
                 indicate that environmental light conditions affect the
                 production of pituitary and sex hormones, and reduce
                 the stress response in S. japonicus.",

  abstract =     "A series of behavioral detection paradigms have been
                 developed for zebrafish (Danio rerio) to examine
                 anxiety-like behavioral responses. Among them, the
                 novel tank diving test is rapidly gaining popularity in
                 translational neuroscience and behavioral research for
                 the investigation of psychopharmacological activity
                 focusing on stress. Zebrafish respond to conspecific
                 epidermal-released alarm substances with antipredator
                 reactions. Although the alarm responses of zebrafish
                 were well characterized in a novel tank diving
                 experiment, the relationship between the intensity of
                 the alarm behavior and the concentration of the alarm
                 substance needed to be understood more adequately. In
                 the current paper, we investigated the behavioral
                 phenotypes and potencies of zebrafish elicited by the
                 serial dilution of an alarm substance in the novel tank
                 diving test. Using a video-tracking assisted behavioral
                 quantification approach, we demonstrated no linear
                 concentration-dependent relationship between
                 antipredator behavior and skin extracts, suggesting
                 that an optimal concentration induced each typical
                 behavioral response. The results showed that the
                 freezing duration (\%) significantly increased when
                 stimulated with 10 4 -fold times dilutions of skin
                 extract (equivalent 5 $ \times $ 10 \minus 5 fish/L),
                 while erratic movements (\%), time in the bottom half
                 (\%), and latency to the upper half (s) significantly
                 elevated when stimulated with 10 3 -fold times
                 dilutions (equivalent 5 $ \times $ 10 \minus 4 fish/L).
                 Therefore, the concentration threshold for an alarm
                 substance that elicited innate fear behavior in
                 zebrafish was presumed to be an equivalent
                 concentration of approximately 5 $ \times $ 10 \minus 4
                 fish/L. The conclusions may fill a knowledge gap
                 between the innate fear response triggered by injured
                 skin and a novel tank diving paradigm that provides
                 insights into the characterization of alarm substance,
                 behavioral responses, and physiological response
                 mechanisms in zebrafish.",

  abstract =     "The upper reaches of the Yangtze River (upper YR) are
                 a biological zone with extremely rich fish diversity,
                 especially endemic fish. However, long-term human
                 interference, such as environmental pollution and
                 cascade hydropower construction, has significantly
                 changed the habitat of many fish and is threatening the
                 number and genetic diversity of fish populations.
                 Jinshaia sinensis is a typical small and endemic but
                 rare fish that is found in the upper YR, and its
                 genetic diversity and structure still need further
                 study. To understand the current levels of genetic
                 diversity in J. sinensis, we analyzed the genetic
                 diversity, population history, genetic structure, etc.,
                 of three J. sinensis populations based on two
                 mitochondrial genes (the cytochrome-c oxidase subunit
                 I, COI, and cytochrome-b gene, Cytb) and two nuclear
                 genes (recombination-activating protein 1, RAG1, and
                 rhodopsin, RH). The genetic diversity analysis
                 indicated that J. sinensis had high genetic diversity,
                 with high haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide
                 diversity (Pi). Population pairwise F ST analysis
                 revealed a significant genetic divergence between the
                 Lijiang and Luzhou populations for all genes and
                 between the Panzhihua and Luzhou populations, except
                 for the COI gene; however, analyses of molecular
                 variance (AMOVA) showed no significant geographic
                 genetic structure among populations, and gene flow
                 analysis also indicated a certain degree of gene
                 exchange among populations. Haplotype network structure
                 analyses revealed low levels of shared haplotypes among
                 populations. Neutrality test and mismatch distribution
                 results indicated that only the Lijiang population had
                 experienced obvious population expansion. Overall,
                 these results indicate that J. sinensis is still a
                 single evolutionarily significant unit, but when
                 considering the threat of habitat disturbance to the
                 population, it is still necessary to carry out
                 long-term genetic monitoring on J. sinensis and on
                 other endemic fishes with similar ecological habits in
                 order to maintain the genetic diversity of fishes in
                 the upper YR.",

                 following a stress challenge, lactate, as well as skin
                 lesions, were analyzed at regular intervals (from 12 g
                 juveniles to 1.5--2.0 kg). The fish grew well, but
                 after 23 weeks, the semi-intensively stocked fish had a
                 mean final weight of 1830.5 g, significantly higher
                 than the super-intensively stocked fish with 1615.4 g,
                 and considerably higher than the intensively stocked
                 fish with 1664.8 g (p {$>$} 0.05). Cortisol and glucose
                 responses significantly differed between stressed and
                 unstressed fish, but not between treatment groups. An
                 unforeseen external stressor (nearby demolition noise)
                 caused stress responses among all treatment groups, but
                 was similarly coped with. Mortality ranged between
                 3.8--9.2\%. In the juveniles, skin lesions were reduced
                 under intensive or super-intensive densities, with the
                 least under semi-intensive densities in outgrown fish.
                 Expression profiles of 22 genes were compared in the
                 spleen at semi-intensive and super-intensive densities.
                 The transcript concentrations of most genes remained
                 unchanged, except for slc39a8 and mtf1, which were
                 significantly downregulated in stressed catfish under
                 semi-intensive conditions. We demonstrated that African
                 catfish growth performance and welfare depend on age
                 and stocking density, also reacting to demolition
                 noise. This supports farm management to optimize

                 terms of economic development and industrial
                 strategies. In the past 10 years, Taiwan's fishery GDP
                 accounted for 14\% to 21\% of all agriculture,
                 forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry, which is
                 higher than both animal husbandry and forestry. Since
                 the domestic population structure of Taiwan has
                 changed, the domestic fishery industrial labor force
                 has gradually been replaced by migrant fishing workers.
                 The issue of migrant fishing workers' protection has
                 received attention from non-governmental organizations,
                 and cross-national recruitment administration has
                 become the greatest challenge faced by Taiwan's
                 authority. Therefore, this paper describes the
                 necessary protection of the labor conditions and
                 interests of migrant fishermen by analyzing their
                 status and human rights protection in the historical
                 development of Taiwan's marine fisheries. In addition,
                 considering the well-being of migrant fishing workers,
                 this paper conducts a feasibility assessment on the

                 protection. This paper suggests that the government
                 agencies should actively advise employers to accept
                 migrant fishermen's requests for better living
                 environments onshore and guarantee basic living

                 (DHA) but a lower percentage of (n-6) PUFA, whereas
                 those fed the bi-algal diatom diet had a higher
                 percentage of arachidonic acid (ARA) and
                 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) but a lower percentage of
                 DHA. The percentages were similar and neither very high
                 nor very low in clams fed the remaining dietary
                 treatments. The results of this study show that sunray
                 venus post-set clams can be successfully produced when
                 fed a typical hard clam bi-algal flagellate and diatom

                 the period 2001--2020, this study applies the threshold
                 panel data model of Hansen (2000) to empirically
                 explore the nonlinear relations between the number of
                 fishing vessels, fishers, and fishery production, with
                 distinct overfishing stocks (overfishing) and fish
                 caught by trawling or dredging techniques (trawling) as
                 the threshold variables. Our findings show that the
                 levels of fishery outputs could be increased by
                 different combinations of primary factors, such as the
                 number of fishing vessels and fishers. More
                 specifically, when the number of fishing vessels and
                 fishermen operating in countries with a high ratio of
                 overfishing (overfishing {$>$} 4.4456) increased, their
                 fishery outputs significantly increased as compared
                 with countries with a low percentage of overfishing. As
                 overfishing activities increase, they can result in
                 significant shortages and imbalances of fishery
                 resources, directly influencing fish biomass,
                 biodiversity, and sustainability of fisheries, as well
                 as making destructive fishing practices worse for
                 marine ecosystems. Countries with a relatively high
                 proportion of trawler net usage (trawling {$>$} 4.5516)
                 would have significantly lower fishery outputs, as more
                 fishing vessels are invested in them, compared with
                 countries with a low proportion of trawling net use.
                 This implies that trawler net usage is a
                 non-sustainable fishing technique and harms fishery
                 resources. The policy implications of this study
                 indicate that taxing overfished species and
                 implementing trawling regulations could significantly
                 improve species richness and site-based abundance, thus

  abstract =     "Recreational fishing is common around the
                 Mediterranean Sea. The number of recreational fishers
                 is growing, and they are using increasingly efficient
                 fishing techniques. However, fisher activity is
                 heterogeneous, both temporally and spatially, making it
                 very difficult to determine this sector's fishing
                 pressure and annual yields. Therefore, estimates of
                 annual yields and ecological effects of this fishing
                 sector are limited. In this study, we undertook an
                 extensive survey designed to document and quantify
                 recreational fishing patterns across the Israeli
                 Mediterranean shoreline. We comprehensively quantified
                 recreational fishing using three complementary
                 strategies: (1) ground surveys, including interviews
                 with anglers on the coast, (2) personalized phone
                 interviews, and (3) aerial surveys by helicopter. These
                 methods were used to calculate annual recreational
                 yield and to estimate species and size composition,
                 which were then compared to the commercial fishing
                 catch. We found that a recreational catch makes up
                 between 10\%-37\% of the total annual fishing yields,
                 which is similar to estimates from other regions of the
                 Mediterranean. We also found that non-indigenous
                 species are among the most common species in
                 recreational catch and have become a significant part
                 of local fishery yields. Recreational angling from the
                 coast targets smaller, reef associated species compared
                 to recreational fishers at sea. We identified 23
                 species common to both recreational fishing and
                 commercial fishing, over which conflicts between
                 fishing sectors may arise. These results can be used to
                 more accurately manage Israeli fisheries and can
                 provide a baseline against which to compare future
                 changes in a region under the threats of climate

                 and success is especially important for commercial fish

                 fish and adapting fishing practices for its sustainable
                 exploitation. Predicting tools for determining the
                 combined effect of temperature rise and food quality
                 and quantity reduction (two expected outcomes of
                 climate change) on early-life history traits of fish
                 larvae are valuable for anticipating and adjusting

  abstract =     "Glycogen, a stored form of glucose, is an important
                 form of energy for aquatic shellfish, contributing to
                 the flavor and quality of the oyster. The glycogen
                 synthase (GYS) and glycogen synthase kinase 3\beta
                 (GSK3\beta) are two major enzymes in the glycogenesis.
                 However, the information of the two genes in the
                 Jinjiang oyster Crassostrea ariakensis remains limited.
                 In this study, we identified the genes of GYS and
                 GSK3\beta and further explored their function in the
                 glycogen synthesis of C. ariakensis. The GYS and
                 GSK3\beta were distributed in all tested tissues, and
                 high expression of GYS and glycogen content were
                 detected in the gonad, labial palp, hepatopancreas, and
                 mantle, while the high expression of GSK3\beta was
                 observed in the gill and adductor muscle. The
                 expression of GYS was positively correlated with the
                 glycogen content, while GSK3\beta was negatively
                 correlated. Additionally, knockdown of GSK3\beta using
                 RNAi decreased the GYS expression, revealing the
                 negative regulatory effect of GSK3\beta on GYS. These
                 findings enrich the research data of GSK3\beta and GYS
                 involved in glycogen synthesis, providing valuable
                 information for further research on the function of

                 humanitarian crises --- more than five million people
                 in the region are hungry and malnourished --- and
                 fishers are in dire need of improved fisheries
                 management policies. Understanding the fishers'
                 resilience, and how they perceive their fisheries
                 policies, could provide an opportunity for governments
                 and fisheries managers to refine their policies. The
                 present study, which is based on 38 semi-structured
                 interviews carried out between January and April 2022
                 on the Nigerian shores of Lake Chad, breaks new ground,
                 firstly by seeking to understand the issues raised by
                 declining fish stocks in Lake Chad from the viewpoints
                 of fishers themselves; and secondly by making use of
                 resilience theory to interpret the fishers' responses
                 to their situation. Our findings are that the fishers
                 have a surer grasp of the most effective resilience
                 strategies available to them than external bodies; and
                 that the fishers' adaptive resilience and local
                 knowledge provide a framework for developing smarter
                 fisheries management policies for Lake Chad. This study
                 provides evidence to support recommendations for
                 Africa's supranational, national and local governments
                 to invest in, and make use of, the fisheries research
                 on the ground to address the problems facing its
                 fisheries, rather than experimenting with seemingly
                 random ideas from across the globe. The Lake Chad
                 fisheries crisis is an extreme case demonstrating the
                 harmful effects of external influences from which the

                 Contrastingly, based on examination of characters taken
                 from the external morphology and osteology, we here
                 recognised six species of Cambeva in GBIA: C. cf.
                 botuvera, a polymorphic and geographically widespread
                 species; C. cubataonis, endemic to the Rio Cubat{\~a}o

                 selection of bivalve has become hot research topic.
                 Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is a species of
                 marine bivalve with important economic value. A new
                 C-type lectin (Rpcl) from the clam was obtained and its
                 potential role in feeding and feed selection was
                 studied. Rpcl cDNA was 929 bp in length and had 720 bp
                 of open reading frame. Rpcl encoded 235 amino acids,
                 comprising a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) as
                 well as an N-terminal signal peptide. Rpcl contained a
                 conserved CRD disulfide bond including five cysteine
                 residues (Cys 125, Cys 142, Cys 213, Cys 219, and Cys
                 237) and the QPN motif (GLN 204 -PRO 205 -ASN 206).
                 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amino acid
                 sequence of Rpcl was closely related to that of
                 Vpclec-1 from R. philippinarum and C-type lectin from
                 Mercenaria. The qPCR analysis indicated that Rpcl
                 expression was observed in all examined tissues and was
                 the highest in gills followed by in the hepatopancreas,
                 and to a lesser extent in the mantle and lip. The in
                 vitro agglutination experiments showed that, the
                 purified Rpcl protein could selectively agglutinate
                 with different microalgae. The strongest agglutinating
                 effect with Chlorella sp. was observed, followed by
                 Karlodinium veneficum and Chaetoceros debilis Cleve. No
                 agglutination with Prorocentrum minimum was observed.
                 In the feeding experiment, compared with that of the
                 starvation group, Rpcl expression in the lip and gill
                 of the clam fed with C. debilis and K. veneficum showed
                 a significant upward trend with the change of time. In
                 addition, it was found that the changes in the
                 expression of the Rpcl gene in the gill and lip, the
                 main feeding tissues, were consistent with the slope of
                 the decrease in the number of algal cells in the water
                 body. In summary, the structure of a new C-type lectin
                 (Rpcl) was reported in this study and its correlation
                 with the feeding and feed selection in R. philippinarum
                 was confirmed.",

                 control and improved welfare. However, optimization of
                 the stocking density for the target species during seed
                 rearing is the key to a successful farming operation.
                 The study evaluated the effect of different stocking
                 density on the growth, feed utilization, digestive
                 physiology and economics in a biofloc-based seed
                 rearing of butter catfish, O. bimaculatus. Advanced fry
                 (1.21 \pm 0.08 g) was reared in a zero-water exchange
                 biofloc system for 90 days at stocking densities of 0.5
                 g/L(T1), 1.0 g/L(T2), 1.5 g/L(T3) and 2.0 g/L(T4). The
                 observed water quality indicates a reduction in DO and
                 pH in T4, while the total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite
                 levels remained low in T1. Among the groups, highest
                 weight gain was noticed in the lowest stocking density
                 (0.5 g/L) (p {$<$} 0.05), which coincides with a better
                 feed conversion ratio. Similarly, the digestive enzyme
                 (protease, amylase, and lipase) secretion was higher in
                 T1. Profitability assessment describes the possibility
                 of low profit in T4, in the case where the fish's sale
                 price is based on harvested size. T1 showed higher
                 individual growth and higher profit. Overall, a low
                 stocking density of 0.5 g/Lis optimum for augmenting
                 growth, feed utilization, physiological function and
                 economic performance of O. bimaculatus. The study

                 -positive, of which 20 were identified as P. damselae
                 subsp. piscicida (Phdp), two as P. damselae subsp.
                 damselae (Phdd) and 25 could not be identified to
                 subspecies. Our results strengthen the view that fish
                 residing in a polluted environment are receptive of
                 pathogenic microorganisms. To assess how the presence
                 of pathogens may affect population management and
                 conservation, this research should be followed by
                 studies aimed at: (i) quantifying levels of pollutants
                 that may affect pathogen emergence, and (ii) creating a
                 standard pollution-level index as a basis for setting
                 criteria, above which authorities should take measures
                 of precaution.",

  abstract =     "Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme that produces and
                 uses phosphocreatine to transfer energy to maintain
                 tissue and cellular energy homeostasis, being
                 considered the main controller of cellular energy
                 homeostasis. Its activity in plasma/serum has been
                 commonly used to evaluate tissue damage, since CK is
                 released into the bloodstream during damage. This
                 review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the
                 use of CK activity in fish, focusing on its potential
                 as an indicator of the impairment of energetic
                 homeostasis and tissue damage during stressful
                 situations, such as exposure to contaminants (metals,
                 pesticides, microplastic), hypoxia, thermal stress, and
                 diseases (fungal, parasitic, and bacterial). Based on
                 the data, we can conclude that tissue CK activity can
                 be used as a suitable indicator of the impairment of
                 energetic homeostasis in fish exposed to different
                 aquaculture challenge conditions, while serum/plasma CK
                 activity can be used as the first evidence of possible

                 Their communities naturally follow the river continuum
                 and have been well described in the western European
                 freshwater watersheds. In regions of higher endemism,
                 such as the Balkan Peninsula, the widely accepted fish
                 zonation of Illies is doubtfully relevant. In this
                 study, a more suitable categorization of lotic and

                 based on 389 multimethodological and multihabitat fish
                 sampling occasions. Referent-type communities have been
                 determined for 33 types of recognized water bodies.
                 Adapted zonation of Illies is a rough estimation of the

                 moreover, sensitive and/or endemic species are
                 generally of restricted distribution and abundance. In
                 view of the lentic ecosystems, they can be divided into

                 YY (PYY) are potent hormones mediating food intake
                 according to the nutritional status in fish. However,
                 limited information is available on these genes and
                 their expression in response to nutrition in silver
                 pomfret (Pampus argenteus). A comparison analysis
                 revealed that ghrelin and GLP-1 were relatively
                 conserved in marine fish. PYYa and PYYb shared a low
                 identity and were clustered to different PYY branches.
                 Ghrelin, pyya, and pyyb mRNAs were highly expressed in
                 the brain, while glp-1 was highly expressed in the
                 gills and liver. The ghrelin mRNA expression was
                 relatively high an hour post-feeding and decreased
                 after 3 to 72 h of fasting. The glp - 1 mRNA expression
                 was increased after 6 to 24 h of fasting. The pyya mRNA
                 expression was increased after 72 h of fasting, while
                 the pyyb expression remained stable during fasting. The
                 diet with 14\% lipid promoted the expressions of glp-1,
                 pyya, and pyyb, but inhibited the ghrelin expression.
                 The ghrelin expression in the intestine was increased

                 decreased the expression of glp-1 and increased the

                 downregulated by LA, DHA, and EPA. These results

                 basis for scientific fish epidemic prevention
                 strategies that can effectively reduce fish mortality
                 and economic loss. However, low-quality underwater
                 images and low-identification targets present great
                 challenges to diseased fish detection. To overcome
                 these challenges, this paper proposes a diseased fish
                 detection model, using an improved YOLOV5 network for
                 aquaculture (DFYOLO). The specific implementation
                 methods are as follows: (1) the C3 structure is used
                 instead of the CSPNet structure of the YOLOV5 model to
                 facilitate the industrial deployment of the algorithm;
                 (2) all the 3 $ \times $ 3 convolutional kernels in the
                 backbone network are replaced by a convolutional kernel
                 group consisting of parallel 3 $ \times $ 3, 1 $ \times
                 $ 3 and 3 $ \times $ 1 convolutional kernels; and (3)
                 the convolutional block attention module is added to
                 the YOLOV5 algorithm. Experimental results in a fishing
                 ground showed that the DFYOLO is better than that of
                 the original YOLOV5 network, and the average precision
                 was improved from 94.52\% to 99.38\% (when the
                 intersection over union is 0.5), for an increase of
                 4.86\%. Therefore, the DFYOLO network can effectively
                 detect diseased fish and is applicable in intensive
                 aquaculture.",

                 Sequencing of the mitochondrial 18S rRNAs confirmed

  abstract =     "The widespread use of drugs is a global problem which
                 affects not only humans but also the environment around
                 them, as research is showing the presence of these
                 substances in different environmental matrices, like
                 air, water, and soil. Above all, due to the remarkable
                 pharmacological properties of drugs, it is discovered
                 that organisms accidentally exposed to them, as aquatic
                 organisms, undergo behavioral and physiological changes
                 that can compromise their health, survival, and
                 reproduction ability. In addition to this, we must
                 consider the ability of some drugs to accumulate within
                 these organisms, thus entering the food chain, and the
                 possible interactions that drugs in water can establish
                 with each other and with other possible pollutants,
                 making the final effects on exposed organisms
                 unpredictable. This article is an overview of the
                 effects of one of these drugs, cocaine, one of the
                 drugs commonly found in the aquatic environment, on
                 European eel, an endangered species and known

  abstract =     "The complete mitochondrial genome of Chirolophis wui
                 (Wang and Wang, 1935) was sequenced using the Illumina
                 platform. The genome sequence is 16,522 bp in length
                 with 54\% A+T content and contains 13 protein coding
                 genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), 2
                 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), and 1 control region
                 (D-loop). The H-strand contains 28 genes (12 PCGs, 14
                 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs), whereas the L-strand accommodates
                 9 genes (ND6 and 8 tRNAs). The nucleotide composition
                 of the mitochondrial genome of C. wui is AT-biased,
                 accounting for 54.0\%, with an AT skew value of
                 {-0}.0556 and a GC skew value of {-0}.2043. The
                 majority of PCGs utilized the start codon, ATG, while
                 only one gene, COI, utilized the alternative start
                 codon, GTG. Of the 13 PCGs, 6 genes used the
                 termination codon (TAA or TGA), whereas 7 genes used
                 the incomplete termination codon (T or TA). Among the
                 22 tRNA genes, the tRNA-Leu and tRNA-Ser were found in
                 duplicates. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using
                 10 complete mitochondrial genome sequences and
                 indicated that C. wui has a very close relationship
                 with C. japonicus and other species in the family
                 Stichaeidae, with a high supporting bootstrap value.
                 This study can provide valuable information for future

  abstract =     "Loss of body armour, sometimes including a reduction
                 in or loss of pelvic spines, is an adaptation observed
                 in many isolated freshwater populations. Pelvic
                 reduction in sticklebacks has previously been
                 associated with recurrent, but variant, deletions
                 within pelvic enhancer regions Pel A and Pel B, which
                 regulate expression of the homeodomain transcription
                 factor gene Pitx 1. We investigated variation in
                 nucleotide sequences of pelvic enhancers in
                 sticklebacks collected from two small freshwater lakes
                 in the same watercourse and a nearby marine site in
                 subarctic Norway. Spineless, as well as asymmetrically
                 spined and completely spined sticklebacks are present
                 in the upper lake, while only specimens with complete
                 spines are found at the other lake and the marine site.
                 Observed variation at Pel A between the three sites was
                 mainly due to variable numbers of repeats at three
                 fragile TG-repeat loci. The length of Pel A, mainly at
                 one of the TG-repeat loci, was consistently shorter
                 among individuals in the upper lake compared with
                 specimens from the two other sites. However, no obvious
                 association was revealed between enhancer variants and
                 pelvic status. No polymorphism was found at Pel B.
                 Thus, additional genetic factors and/or environmental
                 cues need to be identified to fully explain the
                 occurrence of pelvic reduction in sticklebacks in this

                 studied using specimens captured between March 2010 and
                 March 2012 as by-catch in the shrimp trawl fishery off
                 the coast of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. A total
                 of 347 vertebrae were read, 161 from males
                 (81.6--249.55 mm) and 186 from females (86.15--298.1
                 mm). The estimated average percentage index (IAPE)
                 ranged from 0.71\% to 4.33\% (mean = 2.5\%) in
                 vertebrae from specimens with 1 and 6 band pairs,
                 respectively. In the present study, the different
                 approaches to validation produced variable results
                 (partially valid growth zones). We then decided to
                 discuss the growth of the species considering the
                 formation of an annual ring. There were statistically
                 significant differences in growth between the sexes.
                 The best model to describe male growth was the von
                 Bertalanffy growth model for two phases (VBGM TP) with
                 growth parameters L {\infty} (maximum theoretical
                 length) = 230.35 mm, k (growth constant) = 1.00, t 0
                 (theoretical age of size zero) = {-0}.76 years and for
                 females it was the von Bertalanffy with birth size
                 (VBGM L 0) model with parameters L {\infty} = 282.55
                 mm, k = 0.37. The age of maturity for males and females
                 was 1.52 and 2.02 years, respectively, and the maximum
                 age observed was 5.5 and 8.5 years, respectively.
                 Despite being a fast-growing species, Urotrygon

                 mitogenesis was evaluated. Wild populations in the
                 Potomac River have faced disease and mortality with
                 immunosuppression from exposure to chemical
                 contaminants a suspected component. However, a
                 validated set of immune parameters to screen for
                 immunosuppression in wild fish populations is not
                 available. Prior to use in ecotoxicology studies,
                 ancillary factors influencing the mitogenic response
                 need to be understood. The assay was field-tested with
                 fish collected from three sites in West Virginia as
                 part of health assessments occurring in spring
                 (pre-spawn; April--May) and fall (recrudescence;
                 October--November). Anterior kidney leukocytes were
                 exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E.coli O111:B4
                 or mitogen-free media and proliferation was measured
                 using imaging flow cytometry with advanced machine
                 learning to distinguish lymphocytes. An anti-smallmouth
                 bass IgM monoclonal antibody was used to identify IgM+
                 lymphocytes. Lymphocyte mitogenesis, or proliferative
                 responses, varied by site and season and positively and
                 negatively correlated with factors such as sex, age,
                 tissue parasites, and macrophage aggregates. Background
                 proliferation of {IgM-} lymphocytes was negatively
                 correlated to LPS-induced proliferation in both seasons
                 at all sites, but only in spring for IgM+ lymphocytes.
                 The results demonstrate that many factors, in addition
                 to chemical contaminants, may influence lymphocyte

                 commercial fish species, providing reliable protein and
                 income sources. However, their stocks are dwindling on
                 Lake Kyoga due to land use and land cover (LULC)
                 changes within the surrounding catchment. Thus, this
                 paper aims at assessing the land use land cover on Lake
                 Kyoga and its immediate catchment and how those changes
                 affect the water quality and the local fish catches.
                 The Iso-Cluster tool in ArcGIS was used to analyze
                 Landsat images from the years 1989 to 2021 to obtain
                 LULC information. The LULC classes were classified into
                 water, wetland, agricultural land, rangeland, and
                 settlements. Correction using a 2-tailed test of the
                 water quality parameters with the LULC classes
                 indicated a strong positive correlation of TN with
                 water (0.71), a strong negative correlation of TP with
                 rangelands ({-0}.83), and a strong positive correlation
                 of Chl- a with settlement (0.98) at a 0.05 confidence
                 level. The correlation of the recorded fish catch data
                 with fishing gear showed a strong negative correlation
                 with cast and monofilament nets. Continued use of
                 illegal fishing gear was ranked number 1 of the causes
                 of LULC by the stakeholders. Thus, the fisheries
                 managers should collaborate with local stakeholders to

                 The diet variability of seven fish species forming a
                 community in a Neotropical riverine system was analyzed
                 to characterize the resource and consumer linkages,

                 sampled along four sites during a year, and their
                 stomach contents were analyzed. Feeding data were
                 analyzed by applying quali- and quantitative methods
                 with multi-levels and multifactor aspects to determine

                 developing nervous system that manifests in behavioral
                 patterns that do not match those of typical subjects.
                 Moreover, starting at puberty, these children may
                 encounter problems regarding social interaction related
                 to sexual encounters. As studies are scarce, we used
                 the valproate model of autism in the zebrafish to
                 contribute to the knowledge related to sexual behavior
                 in this disorder. Young zebrafish were reproduced,
                 embryos collected, and organized in groups of control
                 or treated with valproic acid, as the autism model.
                 Sexual behavior was recorded in fish from these embryos
                 as they became sexually active. The results show that
                 the zebrafish's sexual behavior is organized into
                 appetitive, preconsummatory, and consummatory
                 behaviors, as in other vertebrates. In the autism
                 model, the patterns of sexual behavior are present but
                 with significant modifications. The behavior of males
                 was the most affected, while in females, the most
                 affected parameter was oviposition. These results show
                 that, in the autism model of zebrafish, sexual behavior
                 is not suppressed, but it seems that critical changes
                 occur in the neuroendocrine system that reduces
                 reproductive success. Furthermore, the enriched
                 environment was beneficial in maintaining the
                 consummatory behaviors of females and males with
                 autism-like behaviors.",

  abstract =     "The objectives of the present study were to evaluate
                 the potential of the Korill (KO), a product based on
                 krill oil, supplemented in fish feed (5 g/kg feed) to
                 alleviate density-induced stress in carp fingerlings,
                 and its protective capacity in case of anthelmintic
                 drug administration (ABZ---albendazole). Thus, the fish
                 were divided into four groups: LD (low density with
                 normal feed), LD-KO (low density with KO
                 supplementation feed), HD (high density with normal
                 feed), and HD-KO (high density with KO supplementation
                 feed). During the first trial, the fish held under
                 different densities were fed normal feed and KO feed
                 for two months, following a 2 $ \times $ 2 factorial
                 experimental design. In the second trial, seven fish
                 per tank were subjected, for one week, to albendazole
                 treatment (administered daily by an oral dose of 5
                 mg/kg body weight). For both trials, blood and plasma
                 samples were used to quantify hematological and
                 biochemical parameters. The results showed that the KO
                 diet alleviated the negative impact of ABZ treatment on
                 liver function and the metabolic profile of carp
                 fingerlings reared in high densities. In addition, KO
                 feeding improved lysozyme activity (LZM) and therefore
                 the immune status of the fish, and reduced oxidative
                 damage in the liver, demonstrated by a decrease of
                 malondialdehyde (MDA) content and an increase of total
                 antioxidant capacity (TAC).",

                 endangered species, is listed as a first-class
                 protected species in China. The natural population has
                 been missing from most of its known distribution areas
                 for many years but was rediscovered in the Taibai River
                 in 2012, providing an important resource for the
                 conservation stocking of the Sichuan taimen. In this
                 study, 43 wild adult Sichuan taimen collected from the
                 Taibai River were determined for gamete maturity for
                 artificial reproduction using ultrasonography. The
                 echogenicity of the gonads before and after hormonal
                 induction was described to determine broodstock
                 identification, injection dose of hormones, and
                 spawning time. Four batches of artificial breeding were
                 successfully achieved in 2013, 2014, and 2016.
                 Broodstock (19 females and 16 males) spawned with
                 average fertilization and hatching rates reaching
                 80.2\% and 61.0\%, respectively. This study
                 demonstrates that ultrasonic imaging is a convenient
                 and efficient method to track the state of gonads of
                 mature Sichuan taimen during artificial reproduction,
                 which will assist in broodstock cultivation, and
                 further large-scale proliferation and effective

  abstract =     "Emerging research on aquaculture governance has
                 pointed to the conundrum of negative global
                 environmental effects from economic incentives for
                 aquaculture production to shift from more highly
                 regulated to less regulated countries. This study has
                 focused on examining whether regulatory costs on U.S.
                 tilapia farms may have contributed to their contraction
                 in contrast to the growth of global tilapia production
                 that contributes to the volume of seafood imports into
                 the U.S. A national survey (coverage rate = 75\% of
                 tilapia sold; response rate = 18\%) found that on-farm
                 regulatory costs accounted for 15\% of total production
                 costs on U.S. tilapia farms, the fifth-highest cost of
                 production. The total direct regulatory costs
                 nationally were \$4.4 million, averaging
                 \$137,611/farm. Most problematic were regulations of
                 effluent discharge, predatory bird control,
                 international export, and water and energy policies.
                 Manpower costs for monitoring and reporting were the
                 greatest cost of regulatory compliance. The lost sales
                 revenue resulting from regulations was \$32 million a
                 year, or 82\% of total annual sales, indicating that
                 the regulatory framework has constrained the growth of
                 U.S. tilapia farming. The smallest tilapia farms had
                 the greatest regulatory cost per kg. This study
                 provides evidence that regulatory costs, along with
                 other challenges related to live fish markets, have
                 contributed to the decline in U.S. tilapia production.
                 Increased competitiveness of the U.S. tilapia industry
                 will require a combination of: (1) improved regulatory
                 efficiency that reduces on-farm cost burdens without
                 reducing societal benefits; (2) research and on-farm
                 extension assistance to evaluate new tilapia fillet
                 equipment; and (3) research on changing consumer
                 preferences to provide guidance on effective strategies
                 to penetrate the large U.S. fillet market.",

                 compounds citral and linalool, respectively. In
                 addition, we evaluated the locomotor activity of
                 amphipods using ANY-maze {\reg} software. Mortalities
                 were observed at concentrations of 100 and 200

                 infection in Egyptian hatcheries and after antibiotic
                 medication. The parameters assessed were the total and
                 differential hemocyte count (THC), granular cells (GC),
                 semi-granular cells (SGC), and hyaline cells (HC). As
                 well as the metabolic and immune enzymes: alanine
                 aminotransferases (ALT), aspartate aminotransferases
                 (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase
                 (ACP), and lysozyme activity; an antioxidant index,
                 such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione
                 (GSH); a phagocytic assay; changes in reactive oxygen
                 species (ROS); and bactericidal activity in the
                 hemolymph of the control, infected, and treated groups.
                 Further evaluation of the mRNA expression levels of the
                 prophenoloxidase (LvproPO), toll-like receptor 1
                 (LvToll1), and haemocyanin (LvHc) genes were performed
                 in the hepatopancreas of the same groups. A significant
                 drop in the THC, GC, SGC, and HC counts, as well as
                 lysozyme and bactericidal activities, phagocytic assay,
                 ROS, SOD, and GSH index, were represented in infected
                 shrimp compared to control shrimp; however, a marked
                 increase in the activity of ALT, AST, ALP, and ACP was
                 observed. These activities were significantly restored
                 in the treated shrimp compared to the infected shrimp.
                 Nevertheless, no significant changes were noted in the
                 transcriptional levels of the LvproPO and LvToll1 genes
                 in the treated shrimp when compared to the infected
                 shrimp; however, a significant suppression of the LvHc

  abstract =     "Fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) is the enzymatic
                 hydrolysis of protein into smaller peptide and free
                 amino acids, which has recently captured considerable
                 attention as a supplementary ingredient in the
                 aqua-feed industry sector. The present research aimed
                 to observe the physiological, biochemical, and
                 bacteriological study of FPH-treated diets and its
                 effects on growth, hematology, plasma biochemistry,
                 liver and gut histopathology, and resistance to
                 Aeromonas hydrophila infection in Pabda (Ompok pabda).
                 Four experimental diets (35\% crude protein) were
                 formulated with graded FPH supplementation (0, 0.5, 1,
                 and 2\%). The feed physiological parameters such as
                 expansion ratio, bulk density, water stability, and
                 floatability were not significantly affected by dietary
                 FPH levels (p {$>$} 0.05), except for the pellet
                 durability index (PDI). Furthermore, the diets with 1\%
                 and 2\% FPH were more palatable to fish than other
                 treatment diets. The total bacteria (TB) in fish diets
                 and guts followed an increasing trend with the increase
                 in various levels of FPH in diets. The significantly
                 highest body weight, specific growth rate (SGR), total
                 biomass (TB), survival rate (SR), condition factor
                 (CF), and hepatosomatic index (HSI) were noted in 2\%
                 FPH-fed fish when compared with other treatment groups
                 (p {$<$} 0.05). The feed intake of fish was
                 significantly increased when increasing the FPH in
                 diets (p {$<$} 0.05). The fish fed with a 2\% FPH diet
                 had significantly higher neutrophil, monocyte,
                 lymphocyte, red blood cell, and platelet levels (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). The blood glucose, creatinine, total
                 protein, and globulin were significantly lower in
                 control fish compared to other treatment groups (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). The histopathological observation of mid
                 intestine tissues displayed that 2\% of FPH-diet-fed
                 fish had a well-anchored epithelial wall with
                 well-arranged goblet cells, a long villus structure,
                 stratum compactum, and tunica muscularis compared to
                 other treatments of FPH. The inclusion of FPH in diets
                 up to 2\% significantly improved the liver health of
                 fish. The fish fed with 2\% FPH had a significantly
                 lower cumulative percent mortality (16.67\%) against A.
                 hydrophila infection in the bacterial challenge test (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). Therefore, the present results suggested
                 that using 2\% FPH in the aqua-feed industry improves
                 the growth performance, health status, and disease
                 resistance of Pabda fingerlings in captivity.",

  abstract =     "The mud crab, Scylla paramamosain, has abundant
                 nutrients in the ovary, where numerous lipids
                 accumulate during ovarian maturation. However, the
                 mechanism behind the accumulation of lipids in the
                 ovary of mud crab during ovarian maturation is largely
                 unknown. This study conducted a comparative
                 transcriptome analysis of the ovaries of mud crabs at
                 various stages of ovarian maturation. A total of 63.69
                 Gb of clean data was obtained, with a Q30 of 93.34\%,
                 and 81,893 unigenes were identified, including 10,996
                 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After KEGG
                 enrichment of these DEGs, MAPK signaling pathway was
                 significantly enriched during vitellogenesis. Moreover,
                 the expression levels of genes involved in
                 carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism were
                 found to be higher during vitellogenesis. The two genes
                 (Sp-Eip75B and Sp-Eip78C) that are homologous to the
                 vertebrate gene PPAR{\gamma} in the PPAR signaling
                 pathway, were identified. Additionally, genes in MAPK
                 signaling pathway might regulate lipid metabolism
                 through PPAR signaling pathway based on Protein-Protein
                 Interaction (PPI) network. These findings suggest that
                 MAPK signaling pathway plays a critical role in lipid
                 metabolism in the ovary during vitellogenesis, which
                 provides new insights into the mechanism of lipid
                 accumulation during ovarian maturation in mud crabs.",

                 We tested the effects of their application on the
                 immune reaction in juvenile turbot. To prevent
                 digestion of the probiotics, rectal administration was
                 applied to maximise colonization, by-passing digestion
                 in the stomach. The application of Psychrobacter
                 nivimaris and Psychrobacter faecalis showed beneficial
                 effects on the inflammatory response and disease
                 resistance after infection with the common pathogen
                 Tenacibaculum maritimum. Treatment with P. nivimaris
                 and P. faecalis resulted in 0\% and 8\% mortalities
                 post-infection, while in the treatment control, an
                 elevated mortality of 20\% was observed. In the
                 challenge controls (no infection), no mortalities were
                 observed during the entire experimental period. After
                 an experimental infection, mRNA expression of selected
                 immune markers (mhc II {\alpha}, il-1{\beta}, tcr, tgf
                 {\beta} and tnf {\alpha}) were determined by RT-QPCR at
                 0, 1 and 5 days post-infection (dpi). At 0 dpi, gene
                 expression was comparable between the treatments and
                 the treatment control, suggesting that probiotics did
                 not act via immune stimulation of the host. At 1 dpi,
                 all genes were up-regulated in the treatment control
                 but not in the probiotic groups, indicating that the
                 infection in probiotic-treated fish developed at a less
                 severe level. At 5 dpi, mRNA expression returned to
                 baseline levels. As a conclusion, the native probiotic
                 candidates P. nivimaris and P. faecalis improved
                 survival, whereas, in the control, mortality increased
                 and expression of the immune markers was up-regulated
                 post infection. This highlights a potential application
                 of P. nivimaris and P. faecalis in disease prophylaxis,

                 an important part of automated vaccine injection. The
                 fry's automatic orientation helps reduce labor and
                 improve efficiency during the automated injection. This
                 paper designed an electromagnetic vibration fry
                 orientation device for grass carp fry, measured its
                 friction characteristics with three different materials
                 in scales and against scales, analyzed the kinematic
                 characteristics of the fry on the electromagnetic
                 vibration feeder, and clarified the main factors
                 affecting fry transport. It used the trough's
                 inclination angle, amplitude, and material as the test
                 factors, whereas the orientation success rate and
                 orientation rate were used as the evaluation index.
                 Orthogonal combination tests were carried out with
                 90--150 mm grass carp fry as the research object to
                 obtain reasonable parameter combinations. The results

                 targeted success rate was {\epsilon} = 95.5\%, and the
                 direction rate was {\eta} = 0.87 tail/s. The device
                 could meet the requirements of the head and tails

                 environments on the flesh quality, the study set up
                 three groups of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys
                 molitrix), that is, pond-farmed; short-term stocked;
                 and ranched, grown in a natural water ranch. This study
                 compared the differences in muscle proximate
                 composition and amino acid composition among three
                 groups. The results showed that there was no difference
                 between the ranched and the stocked groups in content
                 of crude protein, ash, total amino acids (TAA),
                 essential amino acids (EAA), and umami-flavored amino
                 acids (UAA), with both groups being significantly
                 higher than the farmed group. This shows that, in terms
                 of flesh quality, the stocked group was closer to the
                 ranched group and better than the farmed group after
                 being stocked in natural water for 30 days. The results
                 suggest that the flesh quality of farmed fish was
                 improved by short-term stocking in natural water. To
                 elucidate the reasons of flesh quality change in the
                 stocked group, this study compared the food composition
                 and intestinal digestive enzyme activity in three
                 groups, demonstrating that the ranched and stocked
                 groups had similar food composition, with their
                 detritus proportion lower than that of the farmed
                 group, consuming easily digestible phytoplankton
                 diatoms rich in amino acids and fatty acids. No
                 significant difference was seen between the ranched
                 group and the stocked group, for which amylase, lipase,
                 and trypsin activities were lower than that of the
                 farmed group. It is hypothesized that differences in
                 environmental and food composition resulted in lower
                 digestive enzyme activity in the ranched group and the
                 stocked group. In summary, the short-term stocking of
                 farmed fish in a natural water ranch can effectively
                 improve the nutrient content, quality and flavor, and
                 promote value of fish products.",

  abstract =     "Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid,
                 commercially available as a feed-grade product, and is
                 a precursor to serotonin and melatonin, which are both
                 important molecules in stress mitigation. Meagre have a
                 high potential for marine aquaculture diversification
                 but are highly susceptible to stressful conditions.
                 This study aimed to assess the potential role of
                 dietary tryptophan supplementation in meagre juveniles
                 in order to minimize the deleterious effect of
                 potential stress conditions. For this, a growth trial
                 was performed wherein meagre juveniles were fed four
                 isoproteic (45\%DM) and isolipidic (16\%DM) diets;
                 namely, a control diet, and three diets similar to the
                 control diet but supplemented with varying levels of
                 tryptophan, graded according to the resulting
                 percentage in each diet's dry matter (Control,
                 0.25\%Trp, 0.5\%Trp, and 1\%Trp), corresponding to a
                 total dietary tryptophan of 1.06, 1.70, 2.08, and 3.24
                 g 16 g {-1} N, respectively. Diets were tested in
                 triplicate, and fish were fed twice a day, six days a
                 week, for eight weeks. Five days after the end of the
                 growth trial, a time-course blood sampling was
                 performed at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h after
                 feeding. At the 6 h sampling point, the liver was also
                 collected. Overall, our results indicate that 1Trp
                 supplementation (total dietary Trp 3.24 g 16 g {-1} N)
                 may be harmful to fish, decreasing growth performance
                 and feed utilization, although doses up to 0.5Trp do
                 not influence these parameters. Voluntary feed intake
                 lineally decreased with the increase in the level of
                 dietary Trp. Whole-body lipid content decreased at the
                 highest tryptophan inclusion, whereas no changes were
                 observed in protein levels. After 12 h from feeding,
                 plasma glucose levels were lower in all dietary
                 treatments supplemented with tryptophan compared to
                 those observed in the control. Hepatic enzyme activity
                 of protein catabolism decreased with dietary Trp
                 inclusion. Overall, our results suggested that while a
                 dietary Trp level increase of up to 2.08 g 16 g {-1} N
                 did not affect growth performance and feed efficiency,
                 both these parameters were severely compromised with a
                 Trp level of 3.24 g 16 g {-1} N.",

  abstract =     "The transport of living fish is an important part of
                 the fish farming process. The transport usually causes
                 fish stress. This study evaluated the effects of
                 transport temperature and vibration frequency on water

                 histomorphology, oxidative stress, and meat quality of
                 pearl gentian groupers after transport. First,
                 1-year-old groupers (450 {\pm} 25 g) were transported
                 in plastic bags for 48 h, including the following
                 treatments: no shaking, transported at 15 {$^\circ $}C,
                 shaking at 70 rpm, transported at 15 {$^\circ $}C (15
                 {$^\circ $}C/70 rpm); shaking at 120 rpm, transported
                 at 15 {$^\circ $}C (15 {$^\circ $}C/120 rpm); no
                 shaking, transported at 25 {$^\circ $}C; shaking at 70
                 rpm, transported at 25 {$^\circ $}C (25 {$^\circ $}C/70
                 rpm); and shaking at 120 rpm, transported at 25
                 {$^\circ $}C (25 {$^\circ $}C/120 rpm). Serum, liver,
                 gill, and muscle samples were collected for testing at
                 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of exposure. During the 48 h
                 transport, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), superoxide
                 dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase
                 (GSH-PX), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly
                 increased in the transport group compared to the
                 control group. In the early stage of transportation,
                 aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
                 aminotransferase (ALT), cortisol (COR), lactate
                 dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucose (GLU) in the
                 transportation groups were significantly higher than
                 those in the control group, while the water quality pH
                 and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels decreased
                 significantly. Compared with untransported fish, the
                 total free amino acid (TFAA) content increased by
                 40.27\% and 31.74\% in the 25 {$^\circ $}C/70 rpm and
                 25 {$^\circ $}C/120 rpm groups, respectively. In
                 addition, the results of hematoxylin--eosin staining
                 and scanning electron microscopy showed that the
                 epithelial cells in the high-speed group were swollen,
                 the gill lamella was severely curved, and a large
                 amount of mucus was secreted. This study explores the
                 basic information of transportation, which will help to

  abstract =     "Despite the global contribution of aquaculture as an
                 important pillar for food and nutritional security, its
                 rapid growth has been hampered by inadequate and
                 poor-quality seed due to inbreeding, hybridization of
                 related stocks, and poor-quality broodstock. Phenotypic
                 and genotypic characterization of Nile tilapia in
                 natural water bodies of Uganda has been studied but
                 research gaps remain on the morphometric
                 characterization of farmed O. niloticus in Uganda,
                 which hinders selective breeding initiatives. This
                 study characterized O. niloticus from various farmers
                 in Uganda's Southwestern Highland Agro-Ecological Zone
                 using their morphometric traits. In this study, 8
                 morphometric traits were taken on each of the 258 fish
                 samples collected with at least 30 samples sampled from
                 each pond system in the zone. The morphometric data
                 generated were analyzed using multivariate analysis. In
                 order to delineate the populations from the different
                 ponds, Discriminant Function analysis (DFA) was
                 performed on the dataset and distribution plots
                 generated to test on the purity of the strains. There
                 were significant differences in the morphometric traits
                 among the populations with the Victoria fish population
                 having the highest standard length while the Kyoga
                 population had the highest weight. Morphometric
                 characterization grouped the fish into three clusters,
                 indicative that fish farms in the zone possibly had
                 different sources of fish seed. The condition factor,
                 which is a measure of wellbeing of the fish, showed
                 that all the populations displayed an isometric growth
                 which is indicative of the fish growing in length as it
                 is in weight. The results of this study provide
                 evidence that local O. niloticus from different farms
                 display differences in body shape as a result of using
                 fish seed from different sources. This aspect can be
                 applied in selective breeding programs after
                 establishing the genetic structure of the farmed Nile
                 tilapia stock.",

                 routine evaluation. Here, Florida's statewide
                 Freshwater Fisheries Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) program
                 is used to show how stakeholder surveys can be integral
                 to this process. In 2022, an online questionnaire was
                 sent to internal stakeholders, i.e., state agency
                 personnel who collect, enter, or use freshwater
                 fisheries data for fisheries and habitat management
                 purposes. The survey's primary objective was to
                 evaluate the program at its 15-year mark; secondary
                 objectives were to compare results with a similar
                 survey conducted at the 4-year mark, compare results
                 among respondents based on experience and functional
                 role, and develop recommendations for strategic
                 initiatives to further improve the program. The survey
                 consisted of 43 questions across six sections of
                 program evaluation: demographics; field sampling; data
                 entry, summary, and reporting; management decision
                 support; programmatic views; and additional input.
                 Respondents generally had positive views of the LTM
                 program, but the survey revealed differences among
                 respondents with different functional roles (e.g.,
                 fisheries researchers and managers viewed the
                 decisional value, priority, and sample sizes of LTM
                 data more favorably than habitat managers) while
                 highlighting high-priority future initiatives (e.g.,
                 database development). Our results demonstrate the
                 utility of stakeholder surveys as an important step in
                 evaluating monitoring programs.",

  abstract =     "Nitrite is a common pollutant encountered in
                 aquaculture systems. During intensive hatchery,
                 accumulation of nitrite can cause massive mortality of
                 juvenile crustaceans. However, the nitrite toxicity and
                 cellular stress responses in juvenile crustaceans is
                 not clearly understood. Here, we investigate the
                 survival, energy metabolism, and cellular stress
                 responses in juvenile P. trituberculatus, an important
                 aquaculture species in China, under acute nitrite
                 stress. The results revealed nitrite resulted in a
                 significant decrease in survival rate of juvenile
                 swimming crab. After nitrite exposure, the activity of
                 catabolic enzymes, such as HK, PK, CS, and CPT-1, were
                 initially enhanced, and then they showed significant
                 decrease at the late stage of exposure, accompanied by
                 reduction in ATP and adenylate energy charge (AEC). The
                 impaired energy homeostasis was possibly associated
                 with disturbed AMPK signaling and enhanced anaerobic
                 metabolism, which was indicated by the high levels of
                 LDH activity and HIF-1{\alpha} expression. Furthermore,
                 we found that nitrite stress can depress antioxidant
                 systems and unfold protein responses, causing oxidative
                 damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and this,
                 in turn, can trigger autophagy and apoptosis through
                 both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent

                 understanding regarding adverse effects of nitrite on

                 (Coregonus autumnalis and C. sardinella) as well as
                 lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) are diadromous,
                 overwintering in freshwater and transitioning to saline
                 waters following ice melt. Since these fish were
                 sampled at the same time and from the same traditional
                 fishing sites, comparison of their skin structures, as
                 revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, has allowed an
                 assessment of influences on wild fish bacterial
                 communities. Arctic char skin microbiota underwent
                 turnover in different seasonal habitats, but these
                 striking differences in dispersion and diversity
                 metrics, as well as prominent taxa involving primarily
                 Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were less apparent in
                 the sympatric salmonids. Not only do these results
                 refute the hypothesis that skin communities, for the
                 most part, reflect water microbiota, but they also
                 indicate that differential recruitment of bacteria is
                 influenced by the host genome and physiology. In
                 comparison to the well-adapted Arctic char, lake
                 whitefish at the northern edge of their range may be
                 particularly vulnerable, and we suggest the use of skin
                 microbiomes as a supplemental tool to monitor a
                 sustainable Indigenous salmonid harvest during this
                 period of change in the high Arctic.",

                 if reduced survival of 3N relative to 2N trout in
                 natural ecosystems during periods of high temperature
                 relate to a lower aerobic swimming capacity and aerobic
                 scope of 3N compared with 2N conspecifics. Three-yearly
                 cohorts of conspecific 2N and 3N hatchery-reared,
                 yearling rainbow trout were ranked for swimming
                 endurance, externally marked for their endurance
                 quantile, and then stocked into two lakes as yearlings
                 to quantify their survival in the wild over summer as a
                 function of ploidy, temperature and endurance; all
                 while tracking temperature and depth habitat
                 utilization via telemetry. As expected, 3N swimming
                 endurance was lower than that of 2N, but with
                 considerable individual overlap. Aerobic swimming
                 endurance, especially for 3N, was predictive of summer
                 survival in a warm lake where piscivorous birds
                 potentially exerted high predation pressure, resulting
                 in low fish survival. This empirical evidence of a

                 provides support for long held assumptions of this

  abstract =     "Smoltification is a key process in Atlantic salmon
                 aquaculture, given it prepares the fish for a
                 successful transit from fresh to seawater. However,
                 industry players have not yet reached a consensus on
                 the best protocols to produce high-quality smolts. In
                 this study, we assessed how the combination of two
                 photoperiod regimes in freshwater (continuous light or
                 LL, and natural photoperiod or LDN) and four transfer
                 times to seawater (February, March, April, and May)
                 affected smolt development and their subsequent growth
                 in seawater until slaughter during commercial
                 production. The results demonstrated that
                 smoltification and growth in freshwater were only
                 slightly modulated by the photoperiod treatment and
                 were instead much more affected by the limiting effect
                 of the low water temperature during that period. In
                 seawater, the growth rate was the highest in the same
                 groups, which had, however, experienced a delay in
                 growth when in freshwater, and consequently, no
                 differences in the final body weight between the eight
                 treatments were found. Such compensatory growth in the
                 sea was probably enhanced by the increasing smolt
                 quality, which could allow for better performance in
                 seawater. A significant link between the weight at
                 slaughter and weight at transfer was observed only in
                 the groups with a lower smolt quality (LL-Feb, LDN-Feb
                 and LDN-Mar), which suggests that larger individuals
                 could cope better with a saline environment. In
                 contrast, smaller smolts probably suffered greater
                 osmotic stress that hindered their performance at sea.
                 Afterwards, as smolt quality increased in the
                 subsequent transfer groups, the relevance of this size
                 effect decreased. This means that the industry may
                 benefit from transferring larger smolts to seawater,
                 especially if these are suspected of having developed
                 suboptimal seawater tolerance. Those individuals are
                 likely to cope better with saline conditions than
                 smaller smolts. Future research should focus on the
                 possible long-term effects of freshwater-rearing
                 regimes on smolt performance in the seawater phase.",

                 pathway of heavy metal bioaccumulation in organisms.
                 Our study used a typical tropical reservoir and fish as
                 a modeling system to test the hypothesis that feeding
                 habits and living habitats significantly affect heavy
                 metal bioaccumulation in fish. Specifically, Cr, Mn,
                 Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb concentrations in water,
                 sediment, and fish, and {\delta} 13 C and {\delta} 15 N
                 in 13 fish species were detected in the Songtao
                 Reservoir of Hainan Province, southern China. Our
                 results indicated that Zn concentration in carnivorous
                 fish was higher than in omnivorous fish. Principal
                 components analysis visually differentiated pelagic,
                 benthopelagic, and demersal fish groups. Moreover, we
                 found that the fish feeding in the demersal habitat
                 showed higher heavy metal levels than those in the
                 pelagic habitat. Additionally, the heavy metal contents
                 in demersal fish were significantly positively
                 correlated with sediments, while no positive
                 correlation was observed in pelagic-feeding fish. The
                 {\delta} 15 N and the concentration of Ni, Zn in fish
                 had a significantly positive correlation, suggesting
                 the potential biomagnification. In contrast, Ni, Fe,
                 Cu, and Cd negatively correlated with fish body
                 weight/length, indicating the growth dilution effects.
                 Finally, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of the metals
                 was far below the provisional tolerable daily intake
                 (PTDI), and target hazard quotients (THQ) were
                 {$<$1}.0, indicating that the fish had no risk for
                 consumption risks. Overall, our finding partially
                 validated the hypothesis that the feeding habits and
                 living habitats significantly influence heavy metal
                 bioaccumulation in fish, which might be a broad
                 generality for metal exposure scenarios in aquatic
                 environments.",

                 Experimental gillnets caught narrow-barred Spanish

                 substantial proportion of individuals larger than those

                 applied ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) to
                 four abundant and different ecological guild larval
                 fish species (Hemiculter bleekeri (freshwater guild),
                 Pseudolaubuca sinensis (freshwater guild), Coilia
                 mystus (brackish water guild), and Engraulis japonicus
                 (marine guild)) to explore their suitable habitats and
                 the fish--habitat relationships in the Yangtze Estuary.
                 The results showed that random forest (RF) demonstrated
                 the best performance in all single algorithms and the
                 surface range envelop (SRE) model was scarcely
                 accurate. The ensemble SDMs demonstrated a superior
                 predictive ability compared with any single algorithm,
                 with the true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under
                 the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
                 scores being above 0.899 and 0.641, respectively.
                 Binary presence--absence maps showed the different
                 spatial distribution patterns of the four species. We
                 primarily found the freshwater species (P. sinensis and
                 H. bleekeri) present in the South Branch (west of
                 {122$^\circ $} E), whereas we found the marine species
                 (E. japonicus) anywhere except inside the South Branch
                 (west of {121.8$^\circ $} E). The area for P. sinensis
                 (1615.93 km 2) was relatively larger than that for H.
                 bleekeri (1136.87 km 2). We predicted that the brackish
                 water species (C. mystus) would most likely be present
                 inside the North Branch (west of {122$^\circ $} E),
                 Eastern Chongming, and outside the South Branch (east
                 of {121.8$^\circ $} E). Salinity, as a key
                 environmental variable, contributed to the spatial
                 variability. A low salinity (sea surface salinity (SSS)
                 {$<$} 3) was beneficial for P. sinensis and H. bleekeri
                 but was not suitable for E. japonicus. The SSS suitable
                 range for C. mystus was 5--10 and 12--20. Multiple
                 ecological guild species dwelled in the confluence of
                 salt and fresh water. Our results will play an
                 important role in the design of specific conservation
                 strategies for fishery resources in this area.",

                 randomly distributed in four equal groups (20 fish per
                 pond in triplicates) and fed various concentrations of
                 NC fortified with 0 (Control), 40 mg/kg (NC1), 50 mg/kg
                 (NC2), and 60 mg/kg diet (NC3) of nano curcumin. After
                 eight weeks of the feeding trial, the fish were
                 challenged with A. flavus for 15 days, and the
                 cumulative mortality was recorded. Fish fed with
                 different concentrations of NC improved significantly
                 (p {$<$} 0.05) the growth performances, feed
                 utilization, and survival rate. There was no
                 significant (p {$>$} 0.05) difference between NC2 and
                 NC3 treatments. However, NC3 exhibited higher
                 performances. Fish feed supplemented with NC decreased
                 the mortality rate when challenged with A. flavus.
                 Hence, dietary supplementation of NC enhanced the
                 growth and health status of Oreochromis sp. and
                 protected it from A. flavus infection. This study

  abstract =     "In Mexico, atrazine is one of the herbicides most
                 widely authorized and used in different irrigation
                 districts. Atrazine is a herbicide that contaminates
                 aquatic systems. Previous studies have shown that
                 atrazine causes damage to red blood cells and liver
                 tissue in different aquatic species, including
                 abnormalities in melanomacrophages. However, more
                 information on amphibians is needed, since most of
                 these studies have been done on fish. Furthermore, no
                 study has determined the effect of atrazine on species
                 native to Mexico. Therefore, in this study, we asked
                 what the effects of atrazine are on the erythrocytes
                 and melanomacrophages of the liver in the male frog
                 (Lithobates spectabilis). In the present study, we
                 analyzed (1) the cytotoxicity of atrazine using the
                 micronucleus test, (2) the area of melanomacrophage
                 centers and the presence of melanin, and (3) the
                 characterization of liver damage using histological
                 techniques. Our results show that atrazine is cytotoxic
                 to erythrocytes, increases the area of and melanin
                 presence in melanomacrophage centers, and causes liver
                 damage in male L. spectabilis. Therefore,
                 hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity are indicators of
                 environmental stress. We suggest monitoring Mexico's
                 aquatic systems and further analyzing atrazine effects
                 and other pollutants on native species.",

  abstract =     "The Rio Grande drainage plays a key role in supplying
                 water and electricity to large urban centres, but some
                 components of its rich ichthyofauna are still poorly
                 known. Based on our field inventories in the middle
                 section of the drainage, we recognised 10
                 trichomycterine endemic species, of which 6 species are
                 new and described herein. A molecular analysis (2600 bp
                 for 43 taxa) indicated that the species of both
                 subgenera do not form monophyletic groups. One species
                 of the subgenus Cryptocambeva is closely related to
                 species from the inner Brazilian Plateau, whereas other
                 species of this subgenus are closely related to species
                 endemic to smaller coastal basins. The species of the
                 subgenus Paracambeva belong to different lineages of a
                 clade endemic to the Rio Grande drainage. These species
                 are diagnosed by the characters of their external
                 morphology and osteology. A key to species
                 identification is provided. The species distribution
                 patterns support delimitation of three areas of
                 endemism, which may have a relevant role for proposals
                 of conservation strategies: the Uberaba, the S{\~a}o

                 last one, a small area confined between the Serra da
                 Canastra and the Rio Grande at the Furnas dam, is
                 particularly important for sheltering three endemic

                 understanding population responses to different
                 management measures and environmental conditions.
                 Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus -Linnaeus, 1758) is
                 an ecologically and commercially important pelagic
                 forage fish species that occupies the southern Gulf of
                 St. Lawrence. Here, we developed von Bertalanffy growth
                 curves and estimated yearly values of generation time
                 for NAFO Division 4TVn Atlantic herring for the years
                 from 1988 to 2021. The results indicate a temporal
                 reduction in the growth and generation time of both
                 spring and fall spawning herring. Over the time series,
                 the generation time of spring and fall spawners reduced
                 by approximately 1 and 2 years, respectively.
                 Furthermore, the average generation time of spring
                 spawners across the time series (6.23 years (95\% CI:
                 5.78--6.85 years)) was approximately 1 year lower than
                 that of fall spawners (7.52 years (6.82--8.34 years)).
                 Overall, the findings of this study can be used to
                 better inform stock assessments and rebuilding plans
                 for 4TVn spring and fall spawning Atlantic herring and
                 highlight the importance of examining temporal trends

                 lantern nets off the coast of northern China was
                 modelled to conduct hydrodynamic tests starting from
                 the culture unit to the entire facility under various
                 current and wave conditions. The experimental results
                 indicated that the drag coefficients of the lantern net
                 model with weights of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 kg were 0.75,
                 0.83, and 0.91, respectively, in the Reynolds number
                 range of 1 $ \times $ 10 4 --1 $ \times $ 10 6. The
                 current-driven upstream mooring line was more dominant
                 than the wave-driven tension, and a simplified model of
                 the longline facility accurately predicted the mooring
                 line tension under the current conditions. The scope of
                 the mooring line (defined as the length of the mooring
                 line related to the water depth) played an important
                 role in eliminating an order of magnitude difference in
                 mooring tension under the wave conditions. The
                 amplitudes of the vertical movement of the longline
                 facility were smaller than the wave height when L / L m
                 was less than 1.5. Therefore, detailed information is
                 needed to better understand the hydrodynamic
                 characteristics and motion response of longline
                 aquaculture facilities for the safe operation of
                 longline structures in offshore environments, in order

                 and a southern (warm) localities. The animals were kept
                 in running seawater in the warm, southern Atlantic
                 locality for a 15-week period. During this period,
                 water temperature was raised to typical southern

                 innate differences which probably have a genetic basis.
                 Race and latitude contributed significantly to gene
                 expression differences, with very different sets of
                 DEGs. A gene ontology analysis showed that races

                 to glutathione metabolism and ATP synthesis in the

                 at age estimates have never been published before. To
                 fill this data gap, the length and age as well as the
                 von Bertalanffy parameters (the most widely used growth
                 model) were estimated. Data from landing samples during
                 the period 2009--2019 were collected by two methods
                 (purse seine and mid-water pelagic trawl). Temporal
                 trends in average length at age, as well as an overall
                 age-length key were obtained and compared with other
                 areas across the geographical distribution range of
                 sardine in the Mediterranean Sea. The observed age
                 range was 0--3 years with most of the individuals
                 belonging to Age 1 (52\%) and Age 2 (43\%). The mean
                 length at age, for the entire study period, was 11.7
                 ({\pm}0.08) cm for Age 0; 13.4 ({\pm}0.09) cm for Age
                 1; 15 ({\pm}0.1) cm for Age 2; and 16.6 ({\pm}0.11) cm
                 for Age 3. Furthermore, during the considered period, a
                 reduction in the length at age was observed in the
                 older classes (Age 2 and Age 3). The estimated
                 parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth model were L
                 inf = 18 ({\pm}1.15) cm, K= 0.459 ({\pm}0.018), and t 0
                 = {$-$1}.99 ({\pm}0.008) and, accordingly, the
                 mortality vector was obtained according to Gislason's
                 model, for each age class, these values were 0.99
                 (0.98--1.02) C at Age 0; 0.71 (0.7--0.73) y {$-$1} at
                 Age 1; 0.6 (0.59--0.62) y {$-$1} at Age 2; 0.54
                 (0.53--0.56) y {$-$1} at Age 3; and 0.51 (0.49--0.53) y
                 {$-$1} at Age 4. Results appeared in agreement with
                 literature from other areas of the Mediterranean Sea
                 and suggested a poor condition status of the sardine
                 stock in the GSA16.",

                 the commercial production of Seriola lalandi larvae and
                 juvenile fish in Chile and New Zealand. Since the rate
                 of malformations in other fish species has been
                 associated with the content of long-chain PUFA
                 (LC-PUFA) in neutral lipids of the diet, the
                 relationship between body LC-PUFA and the rate of
                 malformations, together with a transcriptomic analysis
                 of genes related to the metabolism and transport of
                 lipids in commercially produced S. lalandi larvae have
                 been investigated in the present work. A total of 10
                 batches of S. lalandi larvae were obtained and cultured
                 at about 22 {$^\circ $}C following the protocols of a
                 Chilean commercial hatchery during the spawning season.
                 There were three larval batches that were collected in
                 August (austral winter), three batches that were
                 obtained in October (spring), and finally four spawning
                 events that were obtained in December-January
                 (spring-summer). The rate and type of jaw
                 malformations, the profile of long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA)
                 of total lipids during larval culture, and the
                 distribution of LC-PUFA were analyzed. Additionally, a
                 transcriptome analysis related to lipid metabolism in
                 40-day-old larvae was performed. As a result, a
                 decrease in the rate of malformations was recorded from
                 August to December. DHA showed a steep decrease between
                 days 1 and 10 of culture, probably due to the
                 consumption of yolk sac lipids, but a higher
                 proportional change was noted in larvae that hatched
                 during August. The DHA content in polar lipids (PL) and
                 neutral lipids (NL) of 40-day-old larvae increased from
                 August to December, so that the abundance of DHA was
                 higher in PL in larvae that hatched in December, but it
                 was higher in NL in those larvae that hatched in
                 October. In conclusion, the rate of jaw malformations
                 was associated with the rapid decline in DHA during
                 early larval life and the highest abundance of DHA in
                 neutral lipids at the end of the larval life.",

                 is considered one of the key management approaches for
                 addressing global resource decline and promoting the
                 health and resilience of ecosystems. This paper
                 explores how the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
                 Commission (WCPFC), which manages tuna fisheries, has
                 incorporated the ecosystem approach into its management
                 and decision-making system. This study finds that (1)
                 the WCPFC lacks incentives to adopt EAFM as a whole due
                 to its management priorities on target species and some
                 key bycatch species; (2) inadequate scientific
                 information on associated species and the environment
                 hinders ecosystem risk assessments, leading to delays
                 in EAFM-related decisions; and (3) the organization has
                 given little consideration to human factors. The
                 authors suggest developing an EAFM vision with a clear
                 roadmap to guide the implementation of EAFM and
                 applying area-based management tools in cases where
                 there is limited data and scientific information. The
                 proposed coordination mechanism aims to address growing
                 concerns about labor issues by involving multiple

                 information are available for this species. We
                 therefore performed shotgun LC--MS/MS metabonomic and
                 RNA-seq analyses of the total protein from ``iron
                 prawns''. KEGG analysis revealed that the largest group
                 consisted of a total of 114 KEGG pathway proteins,
                 comparing the ``iron prawns'' with the normal prawns. A
                 total of 423 peptides, corresponding to metabolic
                 pathways, ABC transporters, starch and sucrose
                 metabolism, insulin resistance/secretion, fatty

                 metabolism decreased in female iron prawns, while
                 organic acid and its derivatives increased. However,
                 the pathway of organic acid and its derivatives
                 decreased and lipid metabolism increased in the male

                 gills in molly fish and their role in immunity using
                 light-, electron- microscopy, and immunohistochemistry.
                 The molly fish gills consisted of four holobranchs
                 spaced between five branchial slits. Each hemibranch
                 carried many fine primary and secondary gill lamellae.
                 The gill arch was a curved cartilaginous structure,
                 from which radiated the bony supports of the primary
                 lamellae. The gill arch contained the afferent and
                 efferent brachial arteries. The gill arch was covered
                 by epidermal tissue rich with mucous cells. The primary
                 lamella had a central cartilaginous support and
                 efferent and afferent arterioles and was covered with
                 pavement cells (PVC), salt-secreting chloride cells,
                 and pale-staining mucous cells. These chloride cells
                 contained abundant mitochondria and tubulovesicular
                 system and are involved in ionic transport with a
                 potential role in detoxification. The surface of the
                 secondary lamellae (site of gaseous exchange) consisted
                 of overlapping or interdigitating PVC supported and
                 separated by pillar cells. Other cells were found
                 within the gill epithelium and interstitial connective
                 tissues, including lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes,
                 telocytes, stem cells, astrocytes, and neuroepithelial
                 cells. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that
                 APG-5, iNOS-2, IL-1{\beta}, NF-{\kappa}B, and TGF-B
                 showed positive immunoreactivity in macrophages. The
                 epithelium of the primary gill lamellae contained
                 positive-GFAP astrocytes and S100 protein --- chloride
                 cells. The stem cells expressed SOX9, myostatin, and
                 Nrf2. Neuroendocrine cells expressed S100 protein. In
                 conclusion, the current work suggests that the gills of
                 molly fish are multifunctional organs and are involved

                 ecology as a consequence of fishery effects have never
                 been investigated. In this work, the reproductive
                 ecology of this species was determined in the Southern
                 Gulf of California (SGC). Total length (TL) ranged from
                 11.4 to 51.6 cm, and females were larger than males.
                 Size at maturity (TL 50) was estimated at 27.5 cm for

                 of mature individuals, the presence of pregnant

                 protein recognizes bulky DNA adducts to initiate global

                 carrying germline mutations in the XPC gene display
                 strong susceptibility to skin and certain internal

                 this report, we generated a zebrafish xpc knockout
                 mutant. Zebrafish xpc {$-$}/{$-$} mutant fish develop
                 relative normally and are fertile. However, the mutant
                 embryos were more sensitive to ultraviolet (UV)
                 irradiation. Upon UV irradiation, compared with the
                 wild type embryos, mutant embryos accumulated
                 significantly higher levels of unrepaired DNA damages
                 and apoptotic cells, which led to more severe abnormal
                 development. Transcriptome analysis showed that the p53
                 signal pathway and apoptosis were enriched in the over
                 upregulated genes in UV-irradiated mutant embryos,
                 suggesting that high levels of unrepaired DNA lesions
                 activated p53 to trigger apoptotic activity in mutant
                 embryos. More interestingly, up to 972 genes in the
                 untreated mutant embryos were differentially expressed,
                 compared with those in the untreated WT. Among these
                 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 379 genes did
                 not respond to UV irradiation, indicating that Xpc
                 plays a role in addition of DNA damage repair. Our
                 results demonstrate that Xpc is an evolutionally
                 conserved factor in NER repair. Zebrafish xpc
                 {$-$}/{$-$} mutant also provides a platform to study
                 other functions of Xpc beyond the DNA damage repair.",

                 by genetic introgression with strains of domestic brown
                 trout (Salmo trutta) that were introduced for
                 recreational purposes. The aim of our study was to test
                 if native S. cettii females, rather than zootechnical
                 S. trutta, produce OF with a greater ability to
                 upregulate the sperm motility of conspecific males.
                 Thus, we compared the sperm swimming performances of
                 males inhabiting the Biferno River (Molise region ---
                 Southern Italy) activated in native S. cettii vs.
                 zootechnical S. trutta female's OFs. In our study,
                 native females' OFs (20\% diluted), compared to spring
                 water, has the ability to significantly boost the sperm
                 performance of the autochthonous males, while
                 zootechnical S. trutta fails. These preliminary results
                 suggest that OF-sperm interactions could potentially
                 influence or direct the hybridization mechanisms
                 involving the native Mediterranean trout inhabiting the
                 Biferno River and the domestic lineage of brown trout
                 introduced in the past.",

                 used to mitigate the ecological impact of trawling.
                 Trawling has a large ecological footprint in Taiwan.
                 Thus, this study designed three JTEDs, which differed
                 only in grid interval, for single boat bottom otter
                 trawls that are commonly used in Taiwan. The designed
                 JTEDs were tested in the waters off of Kaohsiung on a
                 Kaohsiung-based bottom trawler, and the results were as
                 follows. (1) At least 300 species were caught, and 189
                 of these species had little commercial value; their
                 weight accounted for 52.5\% of the total catch. (2) The
                 three JTEDs had good exclusion performance. (3) The
                 ratios of the weight of bycatch excluded to the weight
                 of total catch were 7.9\%, 29.1\%, and 36.2\%, for grid
                 intervals of 10, 15, and 20 mm, respectively. (4) JTEDs
                 with grid intervals of 10, 15, and 20 mm were
                 associated with a 0.4\%, 11.5\%, and 19.0\% loss in
                 revenue, respectively. (5) Mature (and thus
                 commercially valuable) Loliginidae tended to be
                 excluded when the grid interval was 20 or (especially)
                 15 mm. In general, the designed JTEDs should be used at
                 a grid size of 15 mm because this strikes the best
                 balance between profitability and sustainability.",

                 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farmers and is regulated
                 by the environment and genetics (e.g., vgll3). Five
                 families of all-male salmon parr (produced using YY
                 males crossed with XX females) with different vgll3
                 genotypes were split between three environmental
                 regimes in January 2018. The ``advanced maturation''
                 regime used elevated temperature (16 {$^\circ $}C) and
                 continuous light from January 2018 with post-smolt
                 maturation assessed in March 2018. The ``extended
                 freshwater'' regime used ambient freshwater (1--16
                 {$^\circ $}C) and simulated natural photoperiod (SNP)
                 with post-smolt maturation assessed in November 2018.
                 The ``sea transfer'' regime used ambient temperatures
                 (1--14 {$^\circ $}C) and SNP in freshwater until May
                 2018 when they were transferred to 9 {$^\circ $}C
                 seawater with natural photoperiod for 2.5 years (final
                 mean weight of circa. 14 kg) and assessed for
                 post-smolt maturation, 1 sea-winter (1 SW) maturation,
                 and 2 sea-winter (2 SW) maturation in the autumn
                 (November/December) of 2018, 2019, and 2020,
                 respectively. Post-smolt maturation was highest in the
                 advanced maturation and extended freshwater regimes
                 (39--99\% depending on family) and lowest in the sea
                 transfer regime (0--95\% depending on family). In the
                 sea transfer regime, maturity incidence increased over
                 time (0--95\% post-smolt maturation, 1--100\% 1 SW, and
                 50--90\% 2 SW maturation, depending on family). In all
                 regimes, those homozygous for the pre-designated vgll3
                 ``early'' maturing allele had the highest incidences of
                 maturation whilst those homozygous for the ``late''
                 allele had the lowest. A low percentage of 2 SW
                 phenotypic and genetic females were found (0--5\%
                 depending on family), one of which was successfully
                 crossed with an XY male resulting in progeny with an
                 approx. 50/50 sex ratio. These results show (i)
                 post-smolt maturation varies dramatically depending on
                 environment although genetic regulation by vgll3 was as
                 expected, and (ii) crossing YY sperm with XX eggs can
                 result in XX progeny which can themselves produce
                 viable progeny with an equal sex ratio when crossed
                 with an XY male.",

                 most turbid and nutrient rich in the world, and as
                 such, they favour the settlement and early development
                 of several species of marine fish. Recent work has
                 revealed a high abundance of Atlantic Goliath Grouper
                 (Epinephelus itajara) in these waters, yet little is
                 known about this species' reproductive biology, which
                 this study aims to complement. During the period from
                 2010 to 2013, we surveyed Goliath Grouper at three
                 rocky sites along the French Guiana coast and examined
                 602 individuals for evidence of maturation. Satellite
                 tags were deployed on five individuals and an acoustic
                 survey was conducted to identify potential spawning
                 movements and activity. We found no evidence of
                 sexually active individuals or local spawning
                 aggregations. Most individuals showed high site
                 fidelity, but one fish was located 1150 km away, near
                 Trinidad and Tobago. We discuss these findings in the
                 context of the wider literature and postulate that
                 Goliath Grouper inhabiting French Guiana reefs
                 originate from spawning sites in northern Brazil and
                 disperse to westerly reefs with the onset of maturity.
                 We propose that the Goliath Grouper populations of
                 South America and Caribbean are linked, and that
                 management of Brazilian source populations could have
                 wide-reaching impacts on Goliath Grouper stocks.",

                 However, cartilaginous fishes are facing various
                 threatens, inflicting abrupt declines in their
                 populations. Thus, critical assessment of available
                 molecular genetic variation, particularly retrieved

                 represents a major resource to foster genomics research
                 in this ancient group of vertebrate species. Briefly,
                 RNA-Seq involves the sequencing of RNA strands present

                 biomarkers. We scrutinized more than 800 RNA-Seq

  abstract =     "Cantharidin, a toxic monoterpene secreted by blister
                 beetles, has long been used in traditional Chinese and
                 modern medicine for its unique properties. However,
                 despite its widespread use, its effects on fish have
                 not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate
                 the potential therapeutic applications of cantharidin
                 in fish by examining its antioxidant, hemagglutinating,
                 hemolytic, and cytotoxic activities at different
                 concentrations (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 {\mu}g
                 mL {$-$1}) in three different cell lines. In addition,
                 the study explored the bactericidal and bacteriostatic
                 properties of cantharidin against various fish
                 pathogenic bacteria. The results revealed that there
                 were no significant differences in antioxidant,
                 hemagglutinating, or hemolytic activities between the
                 different concentrations of cantharidin tested.
                 However, the study found that cantharidin exhibited
                 dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in seabream
                 (Sparus aurata) erythrocytes and in SAF-1, PLHC-1, and
                 Hela cell lines, resulting in morphological changes
                 indicative of apoptosis. Interestingly, the highest
                 dose of cantharidin tested demonstrated potent
                 bactericidal activity against four marine fish
                 opportunistic bacteria, including Vibrio harveyi, V.
                 anguillarum, Photobacterium damselae, and Tenacibaculum
                 maritimum, but no statistically significant changes in
                 bacteriostatic activity were observed against any of
                 the bacteria tested. Overall, these results provide
                 valuable information on the potential therapeutic
                 applications of cantharidin in fish aquaculture.
                 Further research is needed to fully understand the
                 mechanisms of action and to explore possible preventive

  abstract =     "The weight--length relationship (WLR) of fish is a
                 crucial tool in fish biology research and has received
                 extensive attention. However, fish growth is influenced
                 by many factors, and the WLR also changes accordingly.
                 Our aim was to investigate how fish body shape is
                 affected by various factors by analyzing the existing
                 parameters of the relationship between fish body length
                 and weight. We analyzed 198,354 fish specimens
                 belonging to 402 species of 82 families in China and
                 investigated the change of fish body shape in the
                 function of their ecology. Herbivorous fish tended to
                 be shorter and fatter than carnivorous fish, and
                 omnivorous fish fall somewhere in between. This
                 difference could be due to variations in feeding habits
                 and the availability of food sources. Additionally,
                 fish living in lentic waters tended to have a shorter
                 and fatter body shape compared to those living in lotic
                 waters. This could be attributed to differences in
                 swimming behavior in these environments. Furthermore,
                 our results showed that the b value decreased as
                 altitude increased, and fish tended to be thinner and
                 longer due to lower oxygen and temperature levels in
                 high-altitude waters. Overall, our study provides
                 valuable insights into the WLR of fish and the impact
                 of multiple factors on fish body shape.",

                 alternative to plastic is fundamental for the
                 protection of the environment and for the safeguard of
                 marine ecosystems. The replacement of plastic with
                 organic materials for fish storage might affect its
                 shelf-life due to the high concentration of oxidizable
                 fatty acids in fish flesh. This study investigated the
                 effectiveness of two organic packaging materials,
                 namely coconut fiber (Coc) and paper (Pap), as
                 alternatives to the conventionally used polystyrene
                 (Pol), on the shelf-life, hygienic parameters, and
                 quality traits of anchovies refrigerated for one (T0),
                 three (T1), or seven (T2) days. The hygienic quality of
                 anchovies packaged in the organic Pap and Coc boxes was
                 better than the traditional Pol, probably due to the
                 higher porosity of the packaging, which allows a higher
                 bacterial proliferation. Results of the T-BARS test
                 showed a lower (p {$<$} 0.05) malondialdehyde
                 concentration in fillets from the Pap group, which
                 increased (p {$<$} 0.05) from the first to the seventh
                 day of storage. The polyunsaturated fatty acids
                 concentration did not differ between groups, but it
                 decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) from T0 to T2. Coconut fiber
                 and paper are worthy of further investigation since
                 these packaging materials did not affect the shelf-life

                 glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP)
                 in the glycogen-rich cells of the gills of tilapia
                 (Oreochromis mossambicus). In the gills of tilapia, GP,
                 GS, and glycogen were immunocytochemically colocalized
                 in a specific group of glycogen-rich cells adjacent to
                 the gills' main ionocytes and mitochondria-rich cells.
                 Cortisol plays a vital role in the regulation of
                 physiological functions in animals, including energy
                 metabolism, respiration, immune response, and ion

                 mechanisms regulating cortisol and glycogen-rich cells

                 exogenous cortisol and a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
                 antagonist to investigate the regulatory mechanisms
                 between cortisol and glycogen-rich cells in the gills.
                 Our results showed that cortisol promoted the

                 (GPGG) mRNA via GR, whereas the GS gene expression
                 remained unaffected. We also found that GR mRNA was
                 colocalized with some glycogen-rich cells in the gills,
                 further confirming our hypothesis that cortisol
                 directly acts on glycogen-rich cells in the gills of
                 tilapia and regulates glycogen metabolism by promoting
                 GPGG mRNA expression.",

                 Selecting species for risk assessment is daunting for
                 such a diverse pathway. Herein, we discuss a focused
                 method for species selection: choosing important taxa
                 related to known invaders in high-volume pathways and
                 narrowing prospective species lists to manageable
                 groups of potential hazards. We provide an example
                 using 11 damselfishes, a family with high volume in
                 trade and one of the species established in USA waters.
                 We used a specialized literature review and a risk
                 screening tool (Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening
                 Kit) to provide an estimate of risk of invasiveness of
                 marine waters of Florida. The established species was
                 identified as a hazard and potential invasive. All
                 other species scored well below the threshold for
                 invasiveness and future climate had little effect on
                 estimates of invasiveness. The analysis revealed little
                 need for additional risk assessment or prohibitions on
                 damselfishes in trade. Education, monitoring, and early
                 detection and rapid response were the main risk
                 management recommendations. The focused species
                 selection process employed herein provided hazard
                 identification and preliminary risk estimates for just
                 11 species, but collectively, they represent 40\% by

                 organic pollutants (OPs) in the aquatic environment
                 occurs in water, sediment, and then biota. The turbot
                 (Scophthalmus maeoticus) is a benthic fish of
                 commercial interest scarcely studied in the Black Sea
                 region, and none of the studies researched OP
                 concentrations in its main tissues. In this paper,
                 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and POPs,
                 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated
                 biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in water, sediment,

                 were made with gas chromatography on turbots sampled in

                 p,p'DDT and its metabolites p,p'DDE, p,p'DDD --- are
                 dominant in the turbot tissues. From PAHs, benzo(g,h,
                 i)perylene was the dominant compound, while for PCBs it
                 was PCB 52. The OPs' presence in the wild turbot is due

                 generated higher amplicon reads than shrimp fed the
                 control diet. No significant differences were observed
                 in the \alpha -diversity index of the intestinal
                 microbiota of shrimp that were fed the control and EP
                 diet. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria was
                 relatively abundant in the microbiota of shrimp fed
                 both the control and EP diet. The treatment with EP
                 increased the expression of Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes,
                 and Firmicutes, more than the control. The PC analysis
                 revealed that the EP diet altered the bacterial profile
                 in shrimp's intestines into forming different clusters.
                 Unique genera such as Luteolibacter, Simkaniaceae,
                 Haemophilus, Pirellulaceae, Filomicrobium,
                 Sphingomonas, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 along
                 with well-known probiotic genera Bacillus and
                 Lactobacillus were found in the intestine of shrimp fed
                 the EP diet. The PCA eigenvector plots indicated a
                 higher abundance of Bacillus in shrimp fed with EP
                 diet, but a higher abundance of Vibrio in shrimp fed
                 with control diet. These results suggest that
                 encapsulated B. subtilis E20 can be beneficial to
                 shrimp microbiota.",

                 that ranks 11th in global marine fish capture
                 production. However, the reproductive characteristics
                 of this fish have undergone notable changes in recent
                 decades, potentially affecting the quality of offspring
                 and sustainable utilization. To improve our
                 understanding of the physiological regulation of
                 maturation in T. japonicus, untargeted liquid
                 chromatography mass spectrometry was utilized to
                 identify the small molecules that characterize the
                 comprehensive metabolic profiles of ovaries during
                 ovary development from stage II to stage IV. According
                 to the results of OPLS-DA, the ovarian metabolite
                 profiles of the three developmental stages were
                 separated. The concentrations of 124 and 100
                 metabolites were significantly altered between stage II
                 vs. III and III vs. IV, respectively. Lipids and
                 lipid-like molecules accounted for the largest
                 proportion of the altered metabolites, followed by
                 amino acids, peptides, and analogues. The significantly
                 altered metabolites-enriched pathways differed slightly
                 between stages II and III and stages III and IV.
                 Steroid-related pathways were heavily affected during
                 stages II to III, while significantly altered
                 metabolites from stages III to IV were involved in
                 oocyte-maturation-related pathways. Through
                 metabonomics analysis, potentially important metabolic
                 pathways and metabolites between different ovarian
                 stages were detected, providing basic information for

                 typus) is essential for the development of appropriate
                 conservation strategies for the species. This study
                 evaluated the use of the parasitic copepod (Pandarus
                 rhincodonicus) as a proxy to infer short-term foraging
                 habitats and trophic positions of whale shark hosts. To
                 accomplish this, bulk stable carbon ({\delta} 13 C) and
                 nitrogen ({\delta} 15 N) isotope compositions were
                 analysed from 72 paired samples of whale shark skin
                 (dermal) tissues and copepods collected across six
                 years at the Ningaloo Reef aggregation site, Western
                 Australia. This study found that {\delta} 15 N from
                 parasites and whale shark hosts were strongly
                 correlated. As turn-over times of the parasite and
                 whale shark differ (months vs. years, respectively),
                 the ability of copepods to predict {\delta} 15 N values
                 indicates that the trophic positions of whale sharks
                 remain consistent across these timeframes.
                 Contrastingly, {\delta} 13 C in the parasite and host
                 were weakly correlated, likely reflecting differences
                 in the physiology and lifecycle of the copepod parasite
                 compared to the host. Our results suggest {\delta} 15 N
                 from parasitic copepods provides a reliable proxy of
                 the trophic position of their whale shark hosts, but
                 interpretation of {\delta} 13 C values as a proxy for
                 the host will require future studies on the lifecycle
                 of P. rhincodonicus.",

                 Berwickshire and Northumberland are geographically

                 within the Berwickshire and North Northumberland Coast

                 differing fisheries authorities and Minimum
                 Conservation Reference Sizes (MCRS). Morphometric
                 measurements were recorded for each C. pagurus
                 individual to categorise morphometric maturity using
                 segmented regression, with gonadal maturity categorised
                 using visual gonad characteristics and general linear
                 model regressions to compare onset in sexual maturity.
                 Results showed regional variations for gonadal maturity
                 with males reaching sexual onset at a carapace width
                 size of 108.5 mm in Berwickshire and 109.9 mm in
                 Northumberland; females at a size of 126.8 mm in
                 Berwickshire and 120.8 mm in Northumberland. This was
                 also true for morphometric maturity based on chelae
                 height, that males (141.1 mm) and females (134.7 mm)

                 mm) from Northumberland. This study shows that the
                 respective MCRS in both regions are appropriate for the
                 C. pagurus populations, but implications for fisheries

                 g) were stocked in 15 glass tanks (50 $ \times $ 40 $
                 \times $ 60 cm) and randomly allocated to five

                 fish/replicate, 45 fish/TRT), consisting of five
                 isocaloric--isonitrogenous diets. The treatments
                 comprised the basal diet (1) without any additives
                 (control group, CON), (2) with 0.5\% GP (GP0.5), (3)
                 with 1\% GP (GP1), (4) with 0.5\% GNPs (GNPs0.5), and
                 (5) with 1\% GNPs (GNPs1). Fish were manually fed to
                 satiety three times a day (at 9 a.m., 12 p.m., and 2
                 p.m.). Fish were weighed at the start of the
                 experiment, then the body weight, weight gain, feed
                 intake, and feed conversion ratio were determined at
                 the end of the experiment. At the end of the feeding
                 period, 15 fish/TRT were intraperitoneally inoculated
                 with two pathogenic bacterial strains (A. hydrophila or
                 P. putida) in two separate challenge tests. Blood
                 samples were collected from each TRT at two aliquots
                 for hematological and biochemical analysis at the end
                 of the feeding period. A significant improvement in
                 fish growth was observed in GP and GNPs TRTs compared
                 to the control group. There were no significant changes
                 in the total amount of feed intake/fish in response to
                 the experimental diets. Diets enriched with GNPs,
                 particularly the GNPs1 TRT, resulted in a significant
                 increase (p {$<$} 0.05) in digestive enzyme activity
                 (lipase and amylase), serum growth hormone level,
                 proteinogram, and immune indices (lysozyme,
                 immunoglobulin M, interleukin 10, and nitric oxide). In
                 addition, a significant increase in hepatic antioxidant
                 enzymes (superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and
                 catalase) was observed in fish fed with GNPs-enriched
                 diets. Survival percentages following bacterial
                 challenge were higher in GNPs1, followed by GP1 and
                 GNPs0.5 TRTs. Normal histomorphology was found in
                 liver, kidney, and spleen tissues in all experimental
                 TRTs. We conclude that GP and GNPs could be included in
                 Nile tilapia diets for promoting fish growth, immunity,
                 antioxidant status, and disease resistance without
                 harming organ functions. In particular, the most
                 effective treatment was GNPs1.",

  abstract =     "Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) are a typical
                 migratory fish species with high commercial importance.
                 The Pearl River estuary in southern China is an
                 important natural growing ground for Japanese glass
                 eels, but limited information on Japanese glass eel
                 population characteristics is available, despite their
                 ecological importance. In this paper, we examined the
                 annual patterns of the occurrence of Japanese glass
                 eels in the Pearl River estuary from 2011 to 2022. The
                 most frequently occurring Japanese glass eel's total
                 length is 5.3 cm. The collecting period extended from
                 December to February, and the collection
                 catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) decreased significantly
                 from 2011 to 2022. The generalized linear model (GLM)
                 indicated that daily changes in Japanese glass eel
                 collection were significantly affected by tidal range,
                 water temperature, and lunar distance. The catch peak
                 appeared when the tidal range rose to 1.7 m, and the
                 water temperature dropped below 8 {$^\circ $}C on the
                 full moon days. Overall CPUE analysis showed no
                 significant periodic and inter-annual variability in
                 the period 2011--2022, with the ARIMA model suggesting
                 that the CPUE is expected to remain stable but low in
                 the coming years (2023--2026), although recruitment
                 ultimately depends on the overall spawning stock.",

                 can affect the precision of abundance estimates made
                 using `close-kin' mark--recapture procedures. However,
                 empirical evaluation of that variance in natural marine
                 populations can be daunting. Here, a scaling method was
                 used to extend a discrete-time, age-structured model,
                 facilitating investigation of annual and lifetime
                 reproductive success dynamics in Epinephelus itajara.
                 Life tables were synthesized from fishery assessment
                 vital rates and life history measures. For model
                 scaling, a precise empirical estimate of effective
                 population size for the studied population was utilized
                 as the independent variable, and model sensitivity to
                 an informative range of adult abundance was evaluated.
                 The potential for sex reversal to impact reproductive
                 success dynamics was also investigated, albeit in the
                 absence of selective fishing pressure and potential
                 compensatory or depensatory responses. Close-kin
                 relationships in a genetic sample of $ \approx $300
                 adults collected from spawning sites in the Florida
                 Atlantic included numerous full-sibling pairs and
                 multi-sibling families, which is unusual for
                 long-lived, iteroparous marine populations with broadly
                 dispersed larvae. The highly overdispersed reproductive
                 success dynamics modeled for this population and its
                 atypical kinship distribution could have ramifications
                 for planned close-kin mark--recapture analyses. The low
                 observed effective size also has conservation
                 implications. Both issues warrant continued genetic
                 monitoring.",

  abstract =     "Recently, the economic traits of Chinese mitten crab
                 (Eriocheir sinensis) varieties have had a negative
                 tendency. Meanwhile, the status of wild germplasm
                 resources of E. sinensis is unknown, hindering the
                 utilization of wild germplasm resources and the green
                 development of the E. sinensis industry. Thus, the
                 conservation of the wild E. sinensis germplasm resource
                 is of great significance. To this end, we collected
                 wild E. sinensis from two different river basins, the
                 Yangtze River basin, and the Liaohe River basin, and
                 analyzed the genetic diversity as well as the genetic
                 differentiation in E. sinensis populations. Based on
                 eight microsatellite markers, we found moderate genetic
                 diversity in E. sinensis populations regardless of
                 river basin. Based on the mitochondrial D-loop region,
                 we found that all populations are at mutation drift
                 equilibrium, while the Nm between any two populations
                 is greater than 1. We hypothesized the existence of
                 island model gene flow patterns among E. sinensis.
                 Interestingly, genetic differentiation among E.
                 sinensis populations was low, except that between
                 Liaohe and Anqing or Shanghai populations.
                 Additionally, geometric morphological analysis could
                 distinguish E. sinensis from different basins, with an
                 accuracy of 94.2--100\%. Given the similar genetic
                 diversity in the two basins, the genetic convergence of
                 E. sinensis from different basins deserves further
                 attention.",

                 prevalence and transmission pathways in the region, we
                 targeted out-migrating juvenile Pacific Salmon in the
                 Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait in British
                 Columbia, Canada, for PRV-1 molecular screening with an
                 emphasis on Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Coho
                 (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon. A total of 4031
                 individuals were screened for PRV-1 and we identified
                 an overall virus prevalence of 3.5\% from 2011 to 2020.
                 PRV-1 was absent in enhancement facilities and
                 freshwater catchments and predominately found in the
                 marine environment. The detection of PRV-1 varied
                 greatly between species, year and stock of origin, but
                 cumulatively identified that life history and migratory
                 behaviors likely influenced viral prevalence.
                 Specifically, Chinook salmon, which demonstrate long
                 residence time in the Strait of Georgia relative to
                 other species, had the highest PRV-1 prevalence in this

                 detection between year classes within the Strait of
                 Georgia further indicated that the sources for Chinook
                 infection were highly variable between years. These
                 findings enhance our understanding for PRV-1

  abstract =     "Hybrid sturgeon is an important economic fish species
                 in China. In 2021, a bacterium was isolated from the
                 liver and kidneys of freshwater-farmed hybrid sturgeon
                 in Yichang City, Hubei Province, causing a disease with
                 high mortality and surface bleeding. Through
                 morphological observation, 16S rDNA gene sequence
                 analysis, pathogenicity, an antimicrobial sensitivity
                 test, as well as serum physiological and biochemical
                 analysis, it was identified as Staphylococcus
                 saprophyticus and named E702. The 16S rDNA gene
                 sequence of E702 is highly homologous to S.
                 saprophyticus in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed
                 that E702 and S. saprophyticus clustered into one
                 clade. The 50\% lethal dose of E702 was 2.14 $ \times $
                 10 5 CFU/g. The percentages of monocytes and
                 eosinophils were markedly increased in the diseased
                 sturgeon's blood, whereas the percentages of platelets
                 and lymphocytes were decreased. The activity levels of
                 aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase
                 and alkaline phosphatase in the diseased fish were
                 significantly increased. The diseased fish suffered
                 obvious damage to many tissues and organs, especially
                 the liver and kidney, showing swelling, hyperemic and
                 inflammatory cell infiltration. E702 was sensitive to
                 antibiotics such as neomycin, cefazolin, norfloxacin,
                 carbenicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. The study
                 not only proved that S. saprophyticus was responsible
                 for a great deal of hybrid sturgeon deaths, but also
                 shed light on its potential risks in hybrid sturgeon
                 farming. The research results provided the theoretical
                 basis for the diagnosis as well as prevention of this

                 marine crustaceans. This study presents the first
                 report of Mesanophrys sp. infection in the mud crab
                 (Scylla paramamosain). In this study, we first recorded
                 the survival rates of an experimentally infected group
                 and a control group; the cumulative survival rate in
                 the infected group was significantly lower compared to
                 the control group after 72 h (73.20\% vs. 94.19\%),
                 while the highest mortality of S. paramamosain occurred
                 within the first 24 h post-infection. Then, we
                 investigated the dynamic distribution and tissue
                 tropism of the Mesanophrys sp. in the infected S.
                 paramamosain by a quantitative real-time polymerase
                 chain reaction (qPCR). The result showed that a
                 significant increase in the number of Mesanophrys sp.
                 could be detected in all tested tissues (obtained from
                 the eyestalks, gills, heart, nerves, muscles and
                 hepatopancreas) at 3 h post-infection. The numbers of
                 Mesanophrys sp. in the gill, eyestalk and nerve tissues
                 were relatively higher than in the other tissues. The
                 gill tissue showed the highest numbers from 6 to 48 h.
                 Histopathological observation found a severe collapse
                 in the filament structure, which indicated
                 tissue-specific pathogen infection. Furthermore, the
                 antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase
                 (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in three
                 representative tissues (gill, muscle and
                 hepatopancreas) were compared between the infected and
                 control groups, and a significant increase in enzyme
                 activity was observed in all three tested tissues in
                 the infected group, indicating a relatively strong
                 innate immune defense reaction that could have been
                 induced by Mesanophrys sp. infection. These results

                 designed to evaluate the attractive effects using the
                 occurrence rate and attracting index for six
                 commercially important species (Lateolabrax maculatus,
                 Liza haematocheila, Sebastes schlegelii, Acanthopagrus
                 schlegelii, Litopenaeus vannamei, and Amphioctopus

                 seagrass beds (SA and SB) and the traditional
                 double-frame artificial reef (TD). All of the designed

                 The ARs with higher shelter areas (SB and TD) showed a
                 better attracting effect. The efficiency of the ARs in
                 attracting different species depended on their life
                 histories. The bottom-mounted ARs were more efficient
                 in attracting demersal species, while the floating ARs
                 attracted epipelagic fish. In addition, the combined
                 reefs had a better attractive effect than single ARs
                 did. Overall, floating ARs and their combined ARs show
                 the potential to deploy especially for attracting
                 epipelagic fishes, although further study is needed.",

  abstract =     "Gymnesigobius medits is reported for the first time
                 after a recent description recorded from the Balearic
                 Islands and from the slope of the Gulf of Vera on the
                 Iberian Peninsula coast. The record from the Emile
                 Baudot seamount on the Balearic Islands represents the
                 deepest positive benthic gobiiform species record in
                 general. The presence of the membrane connection
                 between the pelvic fins in Gymnesigobius medits,
                 presumed on the damaged fin in the original
                 description, was confirmed. The recently described
                 Gobius xoriguer is the first record from the Pitiusas
                 and Columbretes islands and from the Iberian Peninsula
                 coast. It appears to be widely distributed in the
                 circalittoral bottoms, preferentially in red algae
                 beds. Morphological identification of both species was
                 confirmed using molecular analyses based on the
                 sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
                 subunit I (DNA barcode) gene. The deepest records of
                 gobiiform fishes in oceans and seas are reviewed. The
                 European seas, a well-studied area with eight gobiid
                 species recorded deeper than 200 m, show high bathyal
                 gobiid species richness compared to other areas. The
                 real worldwide diversity of bathyal gobies, although
                 only a fraction of the shallow water species richness
                 of this taxon, is probably much larger than presently
                 known.",

                 materials for Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) feeding
                 on growth, nutritional parameters, digestibility, and

                 diets with 100\% organic raw materials --- the rest of
                 rainbow trout, visceral Iberian pig, and insects as a
                 protein source (TRO, IBE, and INS) --- were tested.
                 After the experiment, growth, nutritional parameters,
                 digestibility, and histology were measured. The CON
                 diet-fed seabream obtained the highest weight; there
                 was no difference between the experimental diets. The
                 crude protein content was the highest in seabream fed
                 the TRO and INS diets. Crude fat was the highest value
                 observed in the CON diet. High digestibility was
                 observed in seabream-fed IBE and INS diets. Except for
                 EAA methionine (Met), there were no static differences
                 in retention efficiency. The diet with the highest
                 hydrolysis rate was IBE. Diet differences were
                 significant but had the typical healthy liver
                 morphology of seabream. Seabream fed on the TRO and INS
                 diets had shorter distal gut measurements. In
                 conclusion, the full substitution of fishmeal with
                 organic raw materials, including rainbow trout remains,
                 Iberian pig viscera, and insects, offers several
                 benefits in terms of digestibility, histology, and
                 growth performance and may help improve sustainable and

                 a highly mobile and plankton-feeding species,
                 classified vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red

                 habitats as found in New Caledonia. Satellite telemetry
                 was used to investigate the horizontal movement ecology
                 of reef manta rays in New Caledonia. A total of 21 reef
                 manta rays were tagged with pop-up satellite archival
                 transmitting tags (21 Fastloc and 2 MiniPAT) that

                 days (mean {\pm} SE = 76.7 {\pm} 50.3). Rays presented
                 a strong site fidelity and an important affinity for
                 coastal waters. Long-distance migrations ({$>$300} km)
                 were also observed, mainly through coastal and shallow
                 water paths. Horizontal movements were compared to a

                 and Relocation. The most dominant pattern was Fidelity,
                 where manta rays remained within their home range for
                 the whole duration of the tag deployment. Our findings

                 become crucial in controlling sea lice levels in
                 salmonid aquaculture. To improve their breeding, there
                 is a need for early sex identification. The genomic
                 region containing the anti-M{\"u}llerian hormone (amh)
                 gene was suggested as the candidate master
                 sex-determining gene in lumpfish. However, the genome
                 of lumpfish contains three copies of amh with ambiguous
                 sex specificity, designated amh1, amh2, and amh3. The
                 study aims to analyse the male-specific region between
                 these amh paralogues for its application as a sex
                 marker. In this study, we utilised polymerase chain
                 reaction (PCR)-based assays to identify the
                 male-specific amh markers in lumpfish and estimate the
                 length of the male-specific region in the lumpfish
                 genome. Our results indicate that a specific genomic
                 region of approximately 27 kilobases (kb), encompassing
                 amh1 and amh2 genes, exhibits male specificity, whereas
                 amh3 is present in both sexes. The developed PCR-based
                 genetic sex identification assays targeting amh1 and
                 amh2 exhibited over 97\% concordance with phenotypic
                 records. Further experiments in other members of the
                 Cyclopteridae: Aptocyclus ventricosus, Eumicrotremus
                 taranetzi, and E. asperrimus revealed male-specific amh
                 genome region only in A. ventricosus. Phylogenetic
                 analyses using the available Cyclopteridae amh
                 sequences suggest that male-specific amh arose early in
                 the Cyclopteridae lineage. Our findings, along with the
                 development of the PCR test, hold great promise for the
                 field of lumpfish aquaculture and will also contribute
                 significantly to future investigations aiming to
                 enhance our understanding of the sex-determination

                 Therefore, it is important to find viable alternatives
                 that contribute to the preservation of quality and
                 increase the shelf life of fishery products, and one
                 alternative is to use natural extracts with
                 antimicrobial activity. The objective of this study was
                 to determine the effect of a natural extract prepared
                 with garlic (NGE) on the quality and shelf life of
                 tilapia fillets stored on ice for 18 days. For this
                 purpose, NGE was prepared by homogenizing peeled garlic
                 cloves with distilled water, which were then
                 centrifuged to obtain the extract (NGE); then, the fish
                 fillets were immersed in the extract and were coated in
                 NGE. The fillets with NGE were packed in high-density
                 polyethylene bags and stored in crushed ice for 18
                 days. The adenosine 5{\prime}-triphosphate (ATP) and
                 degradation products, K-value, color, texture, water
                 holding capacity, pH, total mesophilic count, and total
                 volatile bases (TVB-N) were monitored during storage.
                 The ATP content, K-value, pH, total microbial count,
                 and TVB-N changed with respect to ice storage time, and
                 the results between fillets with NGE and control
                 fillets differed. In conclusion, the application of NGE
                 increased the shelf life of fillets stored on ice by 6
                 days, obtaining a shelf life of 18 days on ice, which
                 shows its potential to improve the utilization of the

                 Downstream of hydropower plants, fluctuating water
                 temperature and flow create dynamic overwintering
                 conditions for juvenile salmonids. We used inSTREAM
                 7.2-SD to simulate the effects of increased temperature
                 (+2 {$^\circ $}C) and discharge (+10\%) on the
                 overwinter growth and mortality of one-summer- and
                 two-summer-old Atlantic salmon and brown trout in a
                 river with a hydropeaking flow regime in a 2 $ \times $
                 2 design with replicated simulations. Water temperature
                 had a major positive relationship with growth for both
                 species and year classes, whereas increased flow alone
                 had no major general effect on overwinter growth. For
                 one-summer-old trout experiencing the high temperature
                 regime, however, increased flow resulted in reduced
                 growth. There were no major effects from temperature
                 and flow on the survival rate of the two-summer-old
                 fishes. On the other hand, there were significant
                 interaction effects for the one-summer-olds, indicating
                 that the effect of flow depended on temperature. For
                 one-summer-old salmon, high flow resulted in increased
                 survival in the low temperature regime, whereas it
                 resulted in reduced survival in high temperature. In
                 contrast, for one-summer-old trout, high flow resulted
                 in reduced survival in the low temperature regime and
                 increased survival in the high temperature. Different
                 hydropower operation alternatives may interact with
                 warming, affecting the relative competitive abilities
                 of stream salmonids. Ecological models that predict the

  abstract =     "Nile tilapia is a high-demand commodity in most
                 developing countries including the Philippines, but its
                 production is hampered by fluctuating water temperature
                 (WT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, which
                 are mostly influenced by temperature warming. Net
                 shading has been demonstrated to reduce pond
                 temperature and increase the rate of spawning in
                 cultured tilapia. The current study aimed to
                 investigate the potential effects of shading on the
                 water quality parameters, blood indices, and serum
                 biochemical profiles of cultured Nile tilapia. Fish
                 were collected from unshaded (control) and shaded
                 (experimental) ponds in three breeding cycles. WT and
                 DO concentrations were measured, while hematological
                 and biochemical analyses were performed. The results
                 showed that the average WT was considerably decreased
                 in the shaded pond with no significant difference in
                 the DO concentrations. Red blood cells, hemoglobin, and
                 lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in fish
                 raised in shaded ponds, although mean corpuscular
                 volume and neutrophil counts were significantly higher.
                 Likewise, Chole, TP, and Alb values were significantly
                 affected by the interaction of cycle and shading setup.
                 Cortisol, Glb, K +, Cl {$-$}, Mg 2+, and TCa values
                 showed significant differences and were only affected
                 by the cycle. Similarly, AST and ALT values showed
                 significant differences and were affected by both cycle
                 and shading setup. Water quality parameters (WT and
                 DO), hematological blood indices, and serum biochemical
                 variables were correlated positively with each other.
                 In brief, prior data imply that net shading can reduce
                 WT in aquaculture ponds, reduce stress in Nile tilapia,
                 and lessen the consequences of temperature warming on
                 species production.",

                 its stocks are currently overexploited and threatened
                 by climate change. Its southernmost populations (in
                 northern Spain) play a key role in conserving the
                 species' original genetic diversity, which is
                 endangered due to decades-long (1970s to 1990s) massive
                 stocking with non-native stocks. Their decline is well
                 documented, but the effect of stock transfer and
                 conservation efforts is unclear. Nine microsatellite
                 loci were amplified from archival samples (scales from
                 1958--1959) from eight Spanish rivers to analyse the
                 species' natural genetic dynamics before its decline
                 started. Allelic richness was high in the historical
                 populations (the 1950s) and above most contemporary
                 estimates. Private alleles were found in most rivers,
                 indicating high local uniqueness and relative isolation
                 among river basins. Some alleles are regional markers
                 since they are rare or absent from contemporary
                 northern European populations. Effective population
                 size suggested good conservation status, with higher
                 values than those estimated for contemporary
                 populations. Strong population structure and genetic
                 differentiation between rivers were found, with limited
                 gene flow, restricted to geographically close
                 populations. Our estimates of historical genetic
                 diversity and structure from southernmost salmon
                 populations are a powerful benchmark to guide
                 conservation programs.",

  abstract =     "As we confront novel environmental challenges, a full
                 understanding of the physical and biological processes
                 that govern species responses to climate change will
                 help maintain biodiversity and support conservation
                 measures that are more robust to irreducible
                 uncertainty. However, climate impacts are so complex,
                 and the literature on salmon and trout is so vast that
                 researchers and decision makers scramble to make sense
                 of it all. Therefore, we conducted a systematic
                 literature review of climate impacts on salmon and
                 anadromous trout as a resource for stakeholders,
                 managers, and researchers. We reviewed studies
                 published from 2010 to 2021 that address climate
                 impacts on these fish and organized them in a database
                 of 1169 physical and 1853 biological papers. Papers are
                 labeled with keywords across eight categories related
                 to subject matter and study methods. We compared the
                 literature by biological process and life stage and
                 used these comparisons to assess strengths and
                 weaknesses. We then summarized expected phenotypic and
                 genetic responses and management actions by life stage.
                 Overall, we found the largest research gaps related to
                 species interactions, behavioral responses, and effects
                 that carry over across life stages. With this
                 collection of the literature, we can better apply
                 scarce conservation resources, fill knowledge gaps, and
                 make informed decisions that do not ignore
                 uncertainty.",

  abstract =     "Oxygen is crucial for the survival of marine species.
                 Yet, the ocean has experienced a loss of approximately
                 2\% of its oxygen inventory since the last century,
                 resulting in adverse impacts on marine life and
                 ecosystems. In particular, changes in the gap between
                 the supply and demand for dissolved oxygen lead to
                 physiological and ecological variations, which cause
                 alterations in habitats and food webs for fish and
                 ecosystem services. These changes vary over time and by
                 region, and the heterogeneous characteristics of marine
                 species bring about non-linear consequences to human
                 society. Despite this, identifying the potential ripple
                 effects of deoxygenation on human society is
                 challenging due to the integrated impacts of other
                 stressors, such as global warming and ocean
                 acidification, and their varying changes depending on
                 environmental conditions and regions, such as upwelling
                 and eutrophication. Therefore, we conducted a
                 literature review on ocean deoxygenation and its
                 effects on fish dynamics and the ecosystem, with a
                 focus on the environmental and societal impact, to
                 present crucial considerations and pathways for future
                 research on ocean deoxygenation. We found that
                 quantitative approaches are necessary to assess the
                 dynamic changes under deoxygenation, and the consequent
                 effects on marine ecosystems should be verified to
                 exploit the natural resources from the ocean. One of
                 the most reliable approaches to quantifying the ripple
                 impacts of deoxygenation is to model spatial and
                 temporal changes with other climate stressors, forming
                 a global network encompassing socio-economic and
                 regional effects of this global change to facilitate
                 and improve capabilities to address the impacts of

                 ``islands'' with limited predation pressure, have been
                 severely impacted by non-native predators. These
                 impacts have been attributed to the evolutionary loss

                 habitats that vary in the degree of isolation and

                 response. We found that pupfish from all five

                 to the alarm cue, regardless of the exposure to
                 predation risk. These data provide evidence that
                 antipredator responses to alarm cues are conserved in
                 Red River pupfish, even in populations isolated from

                 interactions, relationships, and biodiversity within
                 aquatic ecosystems. We analyzed the food sources of 21
                 fish species in 9 families of 6 orders based on the
                 literature data from brackish ecosystems in South Korea

                 contained 173 families, 86 orders, 39 classes, and 22
                 phyla. The 21 fish species were classified into 4
                 groups using hierarchical analysis based on their food
                 sources: Group 1 fishes mainly consumed Amphipoda;
                 Group 2 fishes were zooplanktivores; Group 3 were
                 omnivorous; and Group 4 consumed small food sources,

                 long-term effects of EW and late weaning (LW) on
                 Atlantic cod. Cod larvae were fed with enriched
                 rotifers from 2 to 35 days post-hatch (dph) and weaning
                 carried out from 21 to 35 dph (EW) or with enriched
                 rotifers from 2 to 29 dph followed by enriched Artemia
                 nauplii from 25 to 56 dph and weaning carried out from
                 45 to 56 dph (LW). At 190 dph, 50 fish from each tank
                 were tagged with an electronic tag and were transferred
                 to sea cages at 10 months old. At the end of 30 months
                 post-hatch, the weight of the fish was recorded. Our
                 results showed a significant short-term effect of the
                 weaning method on the growth of Atlantic cod at 65 dph,
                 but no significant difference at 90 and 190 dph.
                 However, fish from LW showed a significantly higher
                 body weight compared to fish from EW at 30 months
                 post-hatch. A cost analysis indicated substantial

                 pollutants that negatively affect fish life, its
                 production and quality. Monitoring individual and
                 collective behaviours produces large amounts of
                 non-linear data that require tailor-suited
                 computational methods to interpret and manage the

                 groups of such non-linear analysing methods that serve
                 as indicators of the complexity (FD) and predictability
                 (entropy) of the behaviours. Since behavioural
                 complexity and predictability may be modulated by
                 contaminants, the changes in its FD and entropy values
                 have a clear potential to be embedded in a biological

                 of the effects of a wide range of environmental
                 contaminants, including toxic compounds, cleaning and
                 disinfecting agents, stimulant (caffeine), anaesthetics

                 indicate the presence of pollutants and underline the

                 evolution of their values prior to them becoming
                 significantly different from the control values, i.e.,

  abstract =     "Brown-marbled grouper is one of the most important
                 mariculture species in China and is widely used as a
                 crossbreeding parent in the grouper industry. Enhancing
                 growth rates is a key target in fish breeding, and
                 gaining insight into the underlying mechanisms
                 responsible for growth differences between individuals
                 can aid in the improvement of grouper growth rates.
                 However, the mechanism behind growth differences in
                 this fish remains unclear. We analyzed the
                 transcriptome profiles of muscle tissues between fast-
                 and slow-growing brown-marbled grouper using RNA-seq
                 and identified 77 significantly up-regulated genes and
                 92 significantly down-regulated genes in the extreme
                 growth groups. Our findings suggest that up-regulated
                 genes such as ghr and tnni2, as well as down-regulated
                 genes such as stc2 and pdp1, are associated with growth
                 advantages in brown-marbled grouper. We used
                 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for GO and KEGG
                 enrichment analyses. The results of the GO enrichments
                 showed that the significantly up-regulated genes in the
                 fast-growing group were involved in protein folding,
                 the actin cytoskeleton, the myosin complex, and other
                 processes. The results of the KEGG enrichments showed
                 that the significantly up-regulated genes in the
                 fast-growing group were involved in various pathways
                 such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, adipocytokine
                 signaling, MAPK signaling, carbon metabolism, and
                 PI3K-Akt signaling. Additionally, gene set enrichment
                 analysis (GSEA) showed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
                 was up-regulated in the fast-growing group, which may
                 be responsible for the higher nutrient absorption
                 efficiency and muscle growth in these fish. Our results
                 contribute to a better understanding of the molecular
                 mechanisms and regulatory pathways underlying fast
                 growth in brown-marbled grouper. However, further
                 studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms

                 parahaemolyticus, in PWS receiving a diet with FM

                 (600 PWS; 10 days) were performed using diets with

                 are in the genus, and where are they distributed? (ii)
                 What are the life histories and ecologies of
                 Pseudoplatystoma species? (iii) What are the patterns
                 of somatic growth for these species? (iv) What is known
                 about the biomass, production, and population dynamics
                 of Pseudoplatystoma? (v) What is the geographic
                 distribution of genetic variation within
                 Pseudoplatystoma species? (vi) What are the threats to
                 the conservation of these species? The taxonomy of the
                 genus currently includes eight species, respectively,
                 distributed over the Orinoco, Amazon, Paran{\'a}, and
                 S{\~a}o Francisco basins. Pseudoplatystoma catfishes
                 typically exhibit longitudinal migrations for
                 reproduction and lateral migration for feeding, but
                 these patterns may vary among populations. The size of
                 the first maturation of these catfishes varies between
                 57 cm to 82 cm in total length. Five of the eight
                 species spawn during the rising water season.
                 Pseudoplatystoma species can grow to about 130 cm in
                 total length and 100 Kg in weight and live until 30
                 years of age, depending upon the species. Biomass
                 production and population dynamics of these catfishes
                 have not yet been fully described. Their life-history
                 characteristics indicate that they are periodic
                 strategists with associated population recruitment
                 dynamics. Population genetic patterning varies among
                 Pseudoplatystoma species, with some degree of homing
                 behavior and genetic differentiation among populations,
                 indicating the need for management by applying the
                 Management Unit and perhaps Evolutionary Significant
                 Unit concepts. The main threats to the persistence of
                 these catfishes are overfishing and alterations in and
                 obstruction of river flow due to the construction of
                 hydropower dams. After synthesizing existing
                 information on species of the genus Pseudoplatystoma,
                 we offer suggestions for future research to fill
                 critical gaps in the knowledge of this group.",

  abstract =     "The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) was
                 established in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea in
                 the early 1990s. The first observation of the species
                 in Latvian waters was in 2004. In the intervening
                 period, the population grew, the species became of
                 significance for local fisheries, and it likely
                 impacted the local ecosystem in the Baltic Sea. In this
                 study, we characterize the spatial--temporal population
                 development of round goby in Latvian coastal waters
                 using data from three different scientific and
                 fisheries-independent surveys. We also include data
                 from commercial fisheries landings to describe the
                 fisheries targeting the species. Our results suggest an
                 exponential increase in population numbers of round
                 goby in Latvian waters, peaking in 2018, followed by a
                 sharp decline. This observation is also supported by
                 data from commercial fisheries landings. We suggest
                 that intensive commercial fishing had a considerable
                 impact on the rapid decline of the species, but that
                 the decline was potentially amplified through a wider
                 scale decline, as observed in many areas of the Baltic
                 Sea. The results of this study contribute to the
                 knowledge base on the species and how fisheries can aid
                 in limiting the development of invasive fish
                 populations. Based on the results of the study, we also
                 provide recommendations for better future monitoring of
                 the species in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea.",

                 produced under different conditions, and their
                 stability to heat (95--130 {$^\circ $}C) and

                 increasingly been exposed to stressful high-temperature
                 events due to global warming. Currently, the effects of
                 thermal stress on skeletal muscle, a key tissue for
                 fish growth, are unknown. This study examined the
                 impact of high-temperature stress on the skeletal
                 muscle transcriptome of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
                 mykiss) in control (15 {$^\circ $}C) and
                 high-temperature (20 {$^\circ $}C) conditions.
                 Additionally, we examined the plasmatic levels of
                 cortisol, glucose, and creatine kinase activity, and
                 examined oxidative damage and autophagy activation in
                 skeletal muscle. High-temperature stress induced
                 significant increases in cortisol and glucose plasmatic
                 levels. Nevertheless, no changes were observed in
                 creatine kinase activity in plasma and skeletal muscle
                 oxidation. Skeletal muscle RNA was isolated and
                 sequenced using the HiSeq Illumina platform. A total of
                 383,796,290 reads were mapped onto the reference
                 rainbow trout genome. The transcriptomic analysis
                 showed that 293 genes were upregulated in the
                 high-temperature group, mainly associated with
                 autophagosome assembly, amino acid transport, and the
                 glutamine metabolic process. On the other hand, 119
                 genes were downregulated in the high-temperature group,
                 mainly associated with digestion, proteolysis, and the
                 muscle contraction process. In addition, RT-qPCR of
                 differentially expressed representative genes and
                 Western blot analysis of LC3-II/LC3-I levels confirmed
                 skeletal muscle autophagy induced by high temperature.
                 This study sheds light on intriguing facets of the
                 adaptive response of rainbow trout skeletal muscle to
                 high-temperature stress and provides significant

                 is a Mediterranean-Atlantic benthic species usually
                 captured as by-catch by Portuguese traditional
                 fisheries and considered the most important commercial
                 fish species of the family Triglidae. However, to date,
                 little is known about its habitat residency and whether
                 the species can be considered a marine
                 estuarine-dependent fish. Otolith microchemistry has
                 proven effective in providing information about fish
                 movement patterns throughout different water
                 salinities. In this study, core-to-edge transects of
                 Sr:Ca in the fish saccular otoliths of 35 juveniles of
                 C. lucerna captured in March 2007 by a scientific
                 survey along the Portuguese coast were used to assess
                 the species movement between brackish and marine
                 waters. Data suggest that most individuals (97\%) have
                 an estuarine-dependent profile, with 63\% showing a
                 clear presence in marine waters during the early life
                 history periods. Evidence of an estuarine residence
                 throughout the fish life cycle was found in only 3\% of
                 individuals. Ba:Ca profiles did not reflect an inverse
                 relationship with Sr:Ca salinity results but
                 corroborated findings from other authors about the
                 influence of upwelling processes and freshwater runoffs
                 on Ba incorporation into the otoliths of coastal fish.
                 Furthermore, the data also showed that C. lucerna can
                 occupy and migrate among habitats with diverse salinity
                 degrees, showing high environmental plasticity and

                 requires successful migration between nursery, feeding,
                 and spawning habitats. Smolting is the major
                 transformation anadromous salmonids undergo before
                 migration to feeding areas. It prepares juvenile fish
                 for downstream migration and their entry to seawater.
                 We reviewed the effects of climate change on smolt
                 ecology from the growth of juveniles in fresh water to
                 early post-smolts in the sea to identify the potential
                 effects of climate change on migratory salmonid
                 populations during this period in their life history.
                 The focus was especially on Atlantic salmon. The shift
                 in suitable thermal conditions caused by climate change
                 results in Atlantic salmon expanding their range
                 northward, while at the southern edge of their
                 distribution, populations struggle with high
                 temperatures and occasional droughts. Climatic
                 conditions, particularly warmer temperatures, affect
                 growth during the freshwater river phase. Better growth
                 in northern latitudes leads to earlier smolting.
                 Thermal refuges, the areas of cooler water in the
                 river, are important for salmonids impacted by climate
                 change. Restoring and maintaining connectivity and a
                 suitably diverse mosaic habitat in rivers are important
                 for survival and growth throughout the range. The start
                 of the smolt migration has shifted earlier as a
                 response to rising water temperatures, which has led to
                 concerns about a mismatch with optimal conditions for
                 post-smolts in the sea, decreasing their survival. A
                 wide smolt window allowing all migrating phenotypes
                 from early to late migrants' safe access to the sea is
                 important in changing environmental conditions. This is
                 also true for regulated rivers, where flow regulation
                 practices cause selection pressures on migrating
                 salmonid phenotypes. The freshwater life history also
                 affects marine survival, and better collaboration
                 across life stages and habitats is necessary among
                 researchers and managers to boost smolt production in
                 rivers. Proactive measures are recommended against
                 population declines, including sustainable land use in
                 the catchment, maintaining a diverse mosaic of habitats
                 for salmonids, restoring flow and connectivity, and
                 conserving key habitats.",

  abstract =     "To better understand differential sensitivities among
                 fish species to the piscicidal compound Antimycin-A
                 (ANT-A), we hypothesized that variations in amino acids
                 at the ANT-A binding site may reflect toxicity
                 differences. Protein sequences for six motifs
                 comprising the ANT-A binding site were obtained and
                 compared for invasive carp species (N = 515) and seven
                 non-target species (N = 277); a consensus was
                 delineated from each species. The carp species, Common
                 Carp (Cyprinus carpio), Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys
                 molitrix), Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis),
                 Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), and Black Carp
                 (Mylopharyngodon piceus), showed the same amino acids
                 at the site; thus, it was termed the carp consensus
                 motif sequence (CCM). Channel Catfish (Ictalurus
                 punctatus) showed the most amino acid polymorphisms,
                 with three motifs 96--100\% different from CCM. Within
                 a species, Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and Fathead
                 Minnow (Pimephales promelas) variation per motif was
                 most dissimilar (46.7\% and 21.6\%, respectively).
                 Organismal mortality data from the literature indicated
                 Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens), Walleye (Sander
                 vitreus), and American Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma
                 cepedianum) to be most sensitive to the piscicide,
                 Catfish least sensitive, and all others intermediate.
                 The protein sequence variations of the binding site
                 appeared to be in accord with organismal sensitivity
                 categories when they differed from the CCM; the motifs
                 in Gizzard Shad and Walleye were the same as in CCM.
                 The physical/chemical nature of ANT-A is important to
                 consider in organismal response comparisons. This
                 cellular approach of studying ANT-A binding at its
                 target enzyme is a non-destructive way to predict
                 piscicidal efficacy of ANT-A against fishes of
                 interest, informs management decisions in control
                 efforts for invasives, and can be used to forecast
                 effects on sympatric species.",

  abstract =     "Metformin is one of the most extensively used drugs,
                 making it one of the most likely endocrine disruptors
                 in the environment, which may negatively affect fish
                 and other freshwater animals. Still, there is a dearth
                 of studies examining metformin's impact on freshwater
                 creatures, like fish. This research aimed to identify
                 the biochemical and genotoxicity effects of the
                 endocrine disruptor metformin in the freshwater fish
                 Labeo rohita at ecologically appropriate doses.
                 Metformin's toxicity was evaluated by subjecting L.
                 rohita to the drug over 28 days at two dosages (40
                 {\SGMLmicro}g/L to 80 {\SGMLmicro}g/L). The results
                 indicated that 40 {\SGMLmicro}g/L and 80
                 {\SGMLmicro}g/L of metformin caused an increase in
                 reactive oxygen species and the generation of free
                 radicals in the body of L. rohita, which in turn caused
                 impairment and alterations in total hemoglobin, red
                 blood corpuscles, white blood corpuscles, oxidative
                 stress, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl activity,
                 respiratory burst activity, myeloperoxidase activity,
                 and lysozyme activity. In addition, animals treated
                 with the maximum metformin dose (80 {\SGMLmicro}g/L)
                 demonstrated substantial DNA damage in the genotoxicity
                 experiment. Metformin's endocrine-disrupting actions
                 may have unintended ramifications for the well-being of
                 aquatic species in their natural habitats. Results of
                 the study demonstrated a serious concern that metformin
                 exposure might be harmful to aquatic life.",

                 receptor (NLR) family members are innate immune sensors
                 involved in the recognition of highly conserved
                 pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
                 Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) is a
                 critical adaptor molecule in multiple inflammasome
                 protein complexes, mediating inflammation and host
                 defense. Caspase1, an inflammatory caspase, has been
                 documented to play important roles in the innate immune
                 system. In this study, we identified and characterized
                 NLRC3-like, ASC, and Caspase1 (referred to as Lm
                 NLRC3L, Lm ASC, and Lm Caspase1) from the spotted sea
                 bass (Lateolabrax maculatus). A sequence analysis
                 revealed that Lm NLRC3L, Lm ASC, and Lm Caspase1 shared
                 similar features with their fish counterparts. Lm
                 NLRC3L contained a FISNA domain, a NACHT domain, and
                 four LRR motifs, followed by a C-terminal fish-specific
                 B30.2 domain. Lm ASC possessed a PYRIN domain for
                 interacting with inflammasome sensor proteins, as well
                 as a CARD domain. Lm Caspase1 had a CARD domain at its
                 N-terminus and a CASC domain at its C-terminus. These
                 three genes were ubiquitously distributed in the liver,
                 spleen, head kidney, gill, intestine, skin, muscle, and
                 brain. They share similar expression patterns, and all
                 demonstrate the highest level of expression in the
                 gill. We analyzed the expression changes in genes in
                 the spleen, gill, and head kidney after stimulation
                 experiments in vivo. After lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
                 stimulation, the expression levels of these three genes
                 were significantly upregulated in the short term,
                 followed by significant downregulation at 48 and 72 h
                 in some examined tissues. Following Edwardsiella tarda
                 infection, these three genes were upregulated in
                 various tissues. However, the expressions of these
                 three genes were not affected by
                 polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C))
                 stimulation. Overall, our results indicate that these
                 three genes are involved in the immune response against
                 bacterial infection in the spotted sea bass, providing
                 the foothold for understanding the immune function and

                 investigated the impact of varying aquaculture
                 soundscapes on largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).
                 Three soundscapes were administered to replicated
                 tanks: Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS:107.7 dB
                 re 1 Pa RMS), In-Pond Raceway System (IPRS:115.1 dB re
                 1 Pa RMS), and Ambient (70.4 dB re 1 Pa RMS) as the
                 control. The initial weight of fish in the three groups
                 was 3.59 {\pm} 0.30 g. Following a 50-day experimental
                 period, the average weight of the Ambient group (14.08
                 {\pm} 0.13 g) was significantly greater than that of
                 the IPRS group (12.79 {\pm} 0.08 g) (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 Examination of physiological samples revealed that the
                 soundscape negatively impacted the fish's
                 immunological, anti-oxidation, and digestive enzymes.
                 Furthermore, the external noise also influenced the
                 locomotive patterns of the fish aggregations. Fish
                 polarity and cohesion were significantly more discrete
                 (p {$<$} 0.05) in both the RAS (47.79 {\pm}
                 {2.34$^\circ $} and 98.52 {\pm} 3.22 mm) and IPRS
                 groups (48.04 {\pm} {0.70$^\circ $} and 87.70 {\pm}
                 7.31 mm) compared to the Ambient group (42.76 {\pm}
                 {1.42$^\circ $} and 85.73 {\pm} 1.57 mm). These results
                 highlight the significant impacts of the aquaculture

                 activities, and behavioral traits of largemouth bass.

                 the modernization of the fishing industry. The
                 operational status of fishing vessels can be identified
                 by using onboard cameras to detect the deck crew and
                 the use of fishing nets. Due to the typically limited

  abstract =     "An extensive survey of macroparasites in 320 European
                 eel Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758) was conducted in
                 two brackish lagoons and eleven freshwater localities
                 in the Mediterranean island of Corsica (France) between
                 spring 2021 and winter 2021--2022. It resulted in the
                 identification of nineteen parasites: two Monogea, four
                 Digenea, one Copepoda, four Acanthocephala, three
                 Cestoda, and five Nematoda, including the first
                 geographical records, as Corsican freshwater sites were
                 studied for the first time. The silvering stage was
                 determined, and the eels were aged through
                 otolithometry to compare parasite communities. Classic
                 parasitology indices, a multivariate analysis, and an
                 analysis of indicator values (IndVal) showed clear
                 preferences towards the host's habitat and salinity.
                 Seasonal variations were shown for several parasites. A
                 dataset from the same two coastal lagoons was used to
                 study the changes in the parasite communities over the
                 last decade, and this showed an increase in the
                 prevalence and abundance of three invasive helminth
                 species: the Monogenea Pseudodactylogyrus bini
                 (Kikuchi, 1929), Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae (Yin and
                 Sproston, 1948) Gusev, 1965 and the Nematoda
                 Anguillicola crassus Kuwahara, Niimi, and Itagaki,
                 1974. These pathogenic parasites were found in all
                 sampled localities, except for the two Monogenea in the
                 polyhaline-to-euhaline Urbino lagoon. It is thus
                 advised that future management measures take into
                 account the environmental preferences of the most
                 concerning parasites.",

                 temporal shifts in fishing effort, and the use of nets
                 or lines in lakes and rivers. The study was based on a
                 temporal series of catch data collected between January
                 1993 and June 2011. The variables analyzed were the
                 total catch, use of gillnets or lines, the environment
                 targeted (lakes or rivers), and fishing effort.
                 Temporal trends in the data series were analyzed using
                 the Mann--Kendall test. An Analysis of Covariance
                 (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate whether gillnet and line
                 catches had independent effects on the catch data.
                 Duncan's test was applied to identify the groups
                 (months) of means that were significantly different
                 from each other. The majority of the catch landings
                 were taken with gillnets (98.65\%) in a lake
                 environment (64.98\%). The temporal series showed a
                 significant decline over time in the gillnet catches
                 from both lakes and rivers, as well as in fishing
                 effort. The influence of the annual flood cycle was
                 reflected in the catches and the flood pulse regulated
                 fishing productivity patterns in the region. The
                 fishers who adapt their activities to this flood pulse
                 have good traditional knowledge of the environment. The
                 results of the study also indicated that any changes in
                 this dynamic system may impact traditional local
                 fisheries and affect the economic wellbeing of local

                 proteolipid proteins. Furthermore, specific
                 downregulated proteins were enriched in

                 largely been obtained from experiments on
                 laboratory-reared animals. Here, the crucian carp
                 (Carassius auratus) with a mean weight of 159.9 {\pm}
                 11.4 g (mean {\pm} SD) were collected from their
                 natural habitats (i.e., Wuhu lake and Poyang lake,
                 China), and the gut microbiota were analysed by using
                 the next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. We
                 obtained more than 430,000 high-quality reads, which
                 constituted more than 1200 operational taxonomy units
                 (OTUs), revealing extremely diverse microbes in the
                 fish gut. Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes
                 and Firmicutes were detected as the prominent phyla
                 (each {$>$} 1\% of total abundance) within the gut
                 microbiota, regardless of the host habitat or the gut
                 segment (i.e., foregut vs. hindgut). Although the
                 microbes in the hindgut were more diverse (OTU number,
                 Shannon and Chao1; One-way Anova, p {$>$} 0.05) than in
                 the foregut, the host habitat had a significant role in
                 shaping the community structures (MRPP, ANOSIM,
                 PERMANOVA, p {$<$} 0.01). Interestingly, we also
                 detected a set of common OTUs, whereby genera Aeromonas
                 and Cetobacterium might comprise the core gut
                 microbiota of crucian carp.",

                 in freshwater environments worldwide. The freshwater
                 mussel Anodonta woodiana is used as a unique
                 bioindicator to monitor Cu contamination in freshwater
                 environments. However, Cu toxicity and response
                 mechanisms in A. woodiana are still largely unknown. A
                 sublethal acute exposure experiment (2.0 mg/L Cu
                 exposure for 72 h) was conducted to investigate the
                 effects of Cu bioaccumulation on ionoregulatory
                 homeostasis, histological features, and transcriptome
                 responses using A. woodiana gills as indicator tissue.
                 The gill bioaccumulation capacity was up to 474. Cu
                 bioaccumulation decreased Na + and Mg 2+ concentrations
                 (p {$<$} 0.05) by 82\% and 17\%, respectively, and
                 induced cilia loss, epithelial desquamation, and
                 filament atrophy of the gills. Transcriptome analysis
                 identified 3160 differentially expressed genes (DEGs),
                 including 1870 upregulated and 1290 downregulated

                 processes, metabolic processes, biological regulation,
                 and responses to stimuli contained the most DEGs in the
                 biological processes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that

                 regulation. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) have been
                 shown to participate in the regulation of OFM with
                 species-specific actions in teleost fishes. In the
                 present study, in vitro treatment of rainbow trout
                 ovarian follicles with recombinant human insulin-like

                 germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), a marker for the
                 resumption of meiosis, in the oocytes. Co-incubation of
                 follicle-enclosed oocytes with rhIGF1 and the
                 maturation-inducing steroid (MIS) in rainbow trout,

                 (17,20{\beta}P), also did not induce GVBD in follicles
                 from rainbow trout that were not able to respond to the
                 MIS alone suggesting IGFs cannot induce oocyte
                 maturational competence (OMC), which is the ability of
                 the oocyte to respond to the MIS. Nevertheless, the
                 addition of rhIGF1 with the MIS increased the
                 proportion of oocytes completing GVBD compared with MIS
                 alone, although this potentiation was small and varied
                 greatly among clutches of follicles from fish with
                 oocytes at different stages of germinal vesicle
                 migration. Collectively, these observations suggest
                 IGFs may have synergistic actions with the MIS but
                 cannot induce resumption of meiosis directly at the
                 oocyte and are not potent inducers of OMC in rainbow
                 trout. Rainbow trout are the first teleost fish in

                 Spawning occurred between 11:00 and 13:00, with the
                 breeding pairs naturally spawning 24 times from 1 June

                 approximately 81 h and 26 min after fertilization at a
                 temperature of 27.0 {\pm} 0.9 {$^\circ $}C. Newly

                 Penaeus vannamei survival rate, water quality factors,
                 and microbial communities were assessed. An analysis of
                 the BG4 powder confirmed the content of probiotic
                 bacteria: 50.2\% Bacillus licheniformis, 48.4\%
                 Bacillus subtilis, and 1.4\% Bacillus
                 amyloliquefaciens, consistent with the information on

                 (1.1 $ \times $ 10 9 CFU/g) was higher than that
                 indicated on the product label (2 $ \times $ 10 8
                 CFU/g). BG4 was added to a sterilized aquaculture water
                 system, according to the indicated bacterial quantity;
                 after 7 days, the maximum ammonia nitrogen, phosphate,

                 fishing (DWF) fleets from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea,
                 Spain, France and others since the 1960s, making DWF a
                 substantial component of the blue economy. Considering
                 this extensive experience of managing DWF activities
                 for more than 60 years, this paper explores the
                 existing policy frameworks and challenges regarding
                 managing DWF. The results show while it is well
                 equipped legally, the country is struggling to
                 implement its national policies and laws while
                 continuing to adopt new management frameworks. This is
                 due to a limited coherence on long-term policy making
                 and policy implementation, resulting in a mismatch
                 between the two, and a paradoxical vision that promotes
                 DWF without the means to monitor fishing activities and
                 their impacts. The existing institutional settings and
                 governance frameworks make change possible in
                 Madagascar's approach to DWF. To improve the management
                 of DWF, this paper outlines four pathways. These
                 include (i) a greater attention on the implementation,
                 harmonisation and evaluation of existing policies and
                 projects; (ii) continuing efforts on transparency for
                 DWF operations and contract negotiations; (iii)
                 realigning aspirations and policies with local needs;
                 and (iv) taking better advantage of measures adopted at
                 the regional Indian Ocean level to improve national
                 management of DWF. An efficient implementation of an
                 improved policy and legal framework could contribute to
                 strengthening the governance of DWF activities toward
                 sustaining national benefits while preserving coastal

                 However, the effects of aquaponics on the welfare
                 status and stress parameters of fish are unclear. In

                 gene expression parameters after acclimation and
                 hypoxia stress, respectively. The remaining crucian
                 carps were randomly divided into three experimental
                 groups with 20 crucian carps in each group (T 0, T 1

                 upregulated in the liver of the T 2 group compared to
                 the NC group and the hypoxia group. The research
                 suggests that aquaponics may reduce the hypoxia stress

                 under hypoxia in Tegillarca granosa (Tg) remains
                 unclear. In this study, we identified gene
                 HIF-1{\alpha} and further explored its function.
                 qRT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA expression
                 of HIF-1{\alpha}, prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHD),
                 hemoglobin (Hb), and myoglobin (Mb) in response to
                 hypoxia. Dual-luciferase reporter analysis was used to
                 assess the transcriptional activity of HIF-1{\alpha} on
                 the PHD and Hb genes during hypoxia. Results showed
                 that the expression levels of HIF-1{\alpha} and PHD
                 mRNAs were highest in the gill and lowest in the
                 adductor muscle. Under hypoxic conditions,
                 HIF-1{\alpha} and PHD mRNAs were both induced, and
                 their expression levels increased significantly,
                 peaking at 8 h and gradually decreasing thereafter. The
                 transcription of Tg-PHD was induced by hypoxia and was
                 Tg-HIF-1{\alpha} dependent. Notably, the expression of
                 Hb decreased in hemocytes (p {$<$} 0.01) after 8 h at
                 0.5 mg/L, while the expression of MbI and MbII
                 increased (p {$<$} 0.01) in the hepatopancreas after 24
                 h and 120 h, respectively. Moreover, Tg-HIF-1{\alpha}
                 could transactivate the PHD promoter but not that of
                 Hb. These findings provide valuable insights into the
                 regulatory role of Tg-HIF-1{\alpha} on Tg-PHD,
                 safeguarding it from degradation by PHD and offering
                 significant contributions to the understanding of

                 of Tg-HIF-1{\alpha} protein was not detected under

                 response of naturally infected M. cephalus were also
                 implemented. In areas where bacterial strains were
                 recovered in a high percentage, water contamination
                 with Cu, Fe, and Ni was higher than the permissible
                 limit. The results showed a high similarity (99--100\%)
                 to Vibrio and E. cloacae strains using phylogenetic
                 analysis of 16S rRNA. Most isolates exhibited
                 sensitivity to florfenicol, ciprofloxacin, and
                 norfloxacin, while they were resistant to erythromycin
                 and amoxicillin. Hemorrhage, oedema, hemosiderosis, and
                 melanomacrophage activation in most affected tissues of
                 infected M. cephalus were detected by light microscopy.
                 Nevertheless, higher levels of AST and ALT, as well as
                 serum inflammatory markers, CRP, and lysozyme activity,
                 were shown in infected fish. There were higher MDA
                 levels, along with a reduction of GSH, SOD, and
                 catalase, in the gills and brain of infected M.
                 cephalus, compared to the control fish. Our obtained
                 data confirmed the high prevalence of Vibrio serovars
                 and E. cloacae in infected grey mullets, describing
                 their histopathological alterations, higher
                 inflammatory response, and oxidative stress impact.
                 These results could be useful indicators for
                 understanding the pathogenesis of these pathogens in
                 correlation with water parameter deterioration. Thus,
                 the emergence of Vibrio and E. cloacae species in this
                 study threatens the brackish water aquaculture industry
                 in Egypt and poses a public health concern.",

  abstract =     "Long-term high stocking density often brings negative
                 effects such as decreased body weight, decreased
                 immunity, and increased mortality to cultured fish,
                 while the effects of short-term stocking are relatively
                 less studied. In this experiment, we characterized
                 spatial and temporal gene expression in black porgy
                 (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) liver by establishing two
                 stocking density groups --- high (H: 26.5 kg/m 3) and
                 low (L: 2.95 kg/m 3) --- and conducting transcriptome
                 sequencing before collecting liver samples at two time
                 points: 6 h (AL and AH) and 60 d (CL and CH) into the
                 culture trial. There were 648 and 550 differentially
                 expressed genes (DEGs) in the AL-vs-AH and CL-vs-CH
                 groups, respectively. The DEGs in the AL-vs-AH group
                 were significantly enriched in steroid biosynthesis,
                 terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, the PPAR signaling
                 pathway, proteasome, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and
                 ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes. The DEGs in the
                 CL-vs-CH group were more significantly enriched in
                 lipid metabolism-related pathways, such as the PPAR
                 signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism, and
                 cholesterol metabolism. In addition, immune-related
                 pathways such as the phagosome and complement and
                 coagulation cascades were also enriched in the CL-vs-CH
                 group. The expression changes concerning the DEGs in
                 each group were further analyzed. The DEGs related to
                 steroid synthesis, protein synthesis, and the
                 degradation pathways were down-regulated, but
                 immune-related genes were generally up-regulated in the
                 AH group. The DEGs related to lipid synthesis were
                 significantly up-regulated in the CH group, but the
                 DEGs related to lipid consumption and utilization were
                 down-regulated. The expression of immune-related DEGs
                 was also negatively affected in the CH group. These
                 results suggest that acute and chronic crowding stress
                 affects lipid metabolism and immune regulation in the
                 liver of black porgy. Acute stress particularly
                 affected hepatic protein metabolism, while chronic
                 stress showed more effects on hepatic lipid metabolism.
                 The results of this study provide a theoretical basis
                 for understanding the effects of high stocking
                 densities upon black porgy and may also provide a
                 reference for crowding stress regulation studies in
                 other fish species.",

                 hotspots and includes many endemic, rare, and important
                 species of both major conservation and economic value.
                 This unique complex of ecosystems also plays a key role
                 for Danube River and Black Sea fish fauna through its
                 role as a natural safe buffer, shelter, feeding,
                 reproduction, and smooth transitional area for a large
                 number of fish species. Climate change is inducing a
                 progressive sea level rise in the Black Sea, a fact
                 that is expected to impact the delta's key complex and
                 dynamic habitats, biocoenoses, and associated biota,
                 and last but not least the key taxonomic group, namely,
                 fish. Around one-third of the fish species of this
                 delta will be greatly affected, sometimes negatively,
                 by this climate change scenario, another one-third to a
                 lesser extent, and the final one-third not at all. The
                 ecological positive feedback of fish can stimulate
                 environmental change and is expected to be responsible
                 for changes within Danube Delta ecosystems, and also
                 for the near Danube River and Black Sea diverse matrix
                 of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Sea level rise
                 in the Black Sea is considered to have been one of the
                 main stress factors of the Danube Delta fish fauna in
                 the past, and is likely to be the case in the future.
                 In this spatio-temporal dynamic context, for the fish
                 species under threat and risk, in situ-adapted
                 management measures are highly required. The current
                 work brings for the first time such a prospective
                 knowledge about the potential impact on Danube
                 River--Danube Delta--Black Sea coast fish diversity in

                 transport glucose to tissues and regulate essential
                 life activities. Its expression is regulated by

                 glucose transport. We cloned H. molitrix glut1 (SLC2A1)
                 and analyzed its sequence using bioinformatics tools.
                 The glut1 cDNA was 2104 base pairs long and encoded a
                 490 amino acid protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
                 that sliver carp glut1 is evolutionarily conserved and

  abstract =     "Smoking represents one of the oldest thermic
                 processing methods of fish, and it was originally used
                 to preserve fish for later meals, delaying spoiling.
                 The objective of this study was to analyze the
                 physicochemical and microbiological safety and quality
                 of two traditionally smoked trout species (Oncorhynchus
                 mykiss and Salvelinus fontinalis). We analyzed the
                 effect of trout processed by traditional smoking,
                 characterizing the samples according to the
                 relationships existing between classical microbial
                 analysis, physicochemical parameters, and the content
                 of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The
                 microbial activity of the smoked fish was very low.
                 Although traditional smoking implies high temperatures
                 and direct exposure to the smoke, Benzo[a]pyrene,
                 Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene,
                 Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, Benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and
                 Indeno [1,2,3-cd]pyrene compounds had undetectable
                 levels in the samples. The products obtained in this
                 study did not exceed the maximum values imposed by EU
                 legislation regarding the TVB-N values during the 30
                 days of the experiment. We conclude that traditionally
                 smoked trout has many advantages in terms of quality
                 and safety of the products. Thus, the obtained products
                 are safe for consumption for at least 30 days after
                 processing.",

                 is no longer sufficient to sustain global aquaculture
                 production. This study had the primary goal of
                 assessing if the replacement of FM with enzymatic
                 soybean meal (ESBM) can affect the performance of
                 growth and immunological response in juvenile Gibel
                 carp. Juvenile fish with an initial weight of 45.02
                 {\pm} 0.03 g were arbitrarily assigned to 18 fish cages
                 of 1 m 3 each, then fed with diets of different levels
                 of ESBM (0\% (control group), 4\%, 8\%, 12\%, 16\%, and
                 20\%) for 159 days. These diets corresponded,
                 respectively, to the replacement levels of 0\% (control
                 group), 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% FM by ESBM.
                 For the parameters of growth and whole-body

                 the control group and other replacement levels (p {$>$}

  abstract =     "Aquaponics (AP) and biofloc technology (BFT) systems
                 rely heavily on bacterial communities to break down
                 organic matter and cycle nutrients that are essential
                 for fish and plant growth. The functional roles of
                 bacterial communities in aquaculture systems are
                 critical to their sustainable operation. Currently, the
                 research on the combination of BFT and AP systems
                 called FLOCponics (FP) is lacking, thereby hindering
                 our ability to optimize their performance. Here,
                 several characteristics (productivity of fish and
                 crops, physicochemical properties of water, and
                 bacterial community) in FP systems cultivating Japanese
                 eel (Anguilla japonica) and leaf lettuce Caipira
                 (Lactuca sativa) were compared to those in the BFT
                 system. Additionally, the effect of fish density on the
                 FP system was investigated. The results indicated that
                 the FP system was more productive than the BFT system.
                 Fish growth rate was highest in the FP system (52.6\%),
                 and the average body weight of eels was 168.2 {\pm}
                 26.8 g in the FP system compared to 140.3 {\pm} 27.0 g
                 in the control (BFT, 5 kg/m 2). However, increasing
                 fish density resulted in lower growth rates, with a
                 growth rate of 20.6\% observed in the high-density (20
                 kg/m 2) experimental group. The bacterial composition
                 was also significantly different between the systems
                 and fish densities, suggesting that bacterial
                 communities may be closely related to the performance
                 of the aquaponics system.",

                 closely related to fish sex, yet the sex differences in
                 fish fatty acids have not been fully known. This
                 experiment investigated the sex differences in fatty
                 acid composition of Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus
                 semilaevis), which have typical sexual dimorphism and
                 reversal. Three sexes, namely females, males and
                 pseudomales, were involved in this study. Five batches
                 of fish samples were collected from different fish
                 farms in Shandong Province, China. These fish were
                 identified to be at the gonadal development stage of
                 III--IV. The disparity of fatty acid between sexes
                 (female vs male and pseudomale vs. male) was evaluated
                 by the distance coefficient (D sex) and multi-variate
                 similarity of percentages analysis (SIMPER). The
                 highest D sex values between females and males were
                 found in gonad, followed by liver and eye. The fatty
                 acids that differed between females and males were
                 mainly DHA, 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and 18:0. The sex
                 difference in DHA and 18:1n-9 contributed significantly
                 to the overall sex difference in fatty acid of brain,
                 eye, and gonad, whereas that in 16:1n-7 contributed
                 significantly in heart, gill, liver, and muscle. The
                 sex difference in 18:0 contributed significantly to the
                 overall sex difference in fatty acid of heart, gill,
                 gut, and skin. The sex differences in fatty acid
                 between pseudomales and males were generally
                 insignificant. In conclusion, at this gonadal
                 development stage (III--IV), the sex differences in
                 fatty acid between female and male Chinese tongue sole
                 have emerged, mainly in the gonad. The testes had
                 higher DHA levels but lower levels of 16:1n-7 and
                 18:1n-9 than ovaries. In addition, for pseudomales, the
                 phenotypic sex more substantially determined the fatty
                 acid composition than the genetic sex.",

                 effects of PPs on the intestinal health of spotted sea
                 bass (Lateolabrax maculatus). A total of 360 spotted
                 sea bass (10.53 {\pm} 0.02 g) were randomly divided
                 into six groups. Fish in each group were fed with
                 varying PP concentrations (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 g/kg) for
                 52 days. The results showed that 12 g/kg PPs
                 significantly increased the body weight gain, specific
                 growth rate, and condition factor, while there was no
                 significant change in the feed conversion ratio. A
                 supplementation dosage of 9 g/kg PPs significantly
                 increased intestinal amylase activity, and 12 g/kg PPs
                 supplementation significantly increased intestinal
                 trypsin activity. In addition, compared with the
                 control group, there was no difference in lipase in the
                 experimental groups. When fed 9 g/kg, the intestinal
                 glutathione content was significantly increased, and
                 the malondialdehyde content was significantly
                 decreased; the effect of PPs on the catalase activity
                 was not significant. PPs improved intestinal
                 morphology, specifically by improving the intestinal
                 villus morphology and increasing the intestinal lining
                 surface area. Compared with the control group, PPs
                 increased the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroides.
                 At the genus level, Cyanobacteria, Muribaculaceae, and
                 Lachnospiraceae were the main flora in the intestinal
                 tract of spotted sea bass. In addition, PPs increased
                 ACE and Chao1 indices of the intestinal microorganisms,
                 while the Simpson index and Shannon index did not
                 change significantly, indicating that intestinal
                 microbial composition and abundance had increased to a
                 certain extent. The results indicated that different
                 levels of PPs in feed can improve the intestinal
                 physiological and biochemical indexes, intestinal
                 morphology, and microbial composition, and thus improve

                 status of the Scophthalmus maeoticus (Pallas, 1814)
                 population from the Romanian marine area in 2016--2019,
                 by identifying and investigating information about
                 bacterial and constitutional diseases, establishing the

                 populations, and highlighting the main biological
                 disorders (reproduction, growth, and feeding) that
                 manifested in the analyzed fish. The bacterial diseases
                 reported in S. maeoticus (Pallas, 1814) populations
                 were caused by pathogens from the genera Vibrio,
                 Aeromonas, and Pseudomonas. Numerous skin diseases,
                 especially various types of ``wounds'', lesions of bony
                 tubercles, and tissue lesions may be the subsequent
                 cause of neoplasms, as a result of fishing gear
                 manipulations. The appearance of significant changes in
                 the prevalence of neoplasia on the Romanian Black Sea
                 coast can be considered an indicator of chronic stress
                 (anthropogenic impact), rather than acute
                 (environmental impact), and we suggest that the species
                 could be used as a biological indicator of changes that
                 may occur in the habitat in which it lives. In terms of
                 future research directions, a combined analysis of the
                 population structure, morphology and diseases
                 determined in S. maeoticus populations, with a

                 should be carried out regularly, to reveal changes in

  abstract =     "The potential of polychaetes for the bioremediation of
                 aquaculture sludge gained more attention in recent
                 years. These organisms can reduce organic matter and
                 nutrients contained in the sludge of several
                 aquaculture species, improving the sustainability of
                 these activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate
                 the removal performance of Perinereis gualpensis
                 (Jeldes, 1963) being fed with aquaculture sludge
                 produced by a recirculating system cultivating Atlantic
                 salmon. The experiment involved adding different
                 amounts of sludge (10\% and 20\% with respect to total
                 substrate) at a density of 300 organisms m {$-$2}
                 during 30 days. A treatment without sludge served as a
                 control, using natural substrate. The highest removal
                 rate of total organic matter (TOM) (23.95 {\pm} 13.19 g
                 m {$-$2} day {$-$1}) was achieved by P. gualpensis with
                 20\% sludge addition, a reduction of about 36\%
                 compared to the total amount added at the beginning of
                 the trials. The organisms fed with aquaculture sludge
                 presented higher nitrogen (8--9\%) and carbon
                 (40--43\%) contents, with a maximum organic carbon
                 assimilation of 32\% in relation to the total content
                 in the sludge. The high survival (88--95\%) and
                 positive growth rates (0.28\% day {$-$1}) achieved by
                 P. gualpensis indicated that this species can be
                 sustained with salmon sludge as the only source of
                 food. These results indicate that P. gualpensis is a
                 promising candidate for removing nutrients from salmon
                 effluents. Moreover, the protein contents achieved by
                 the organisms (52--58\%) meet the dietary protein
                 requirements of several aquaculture species. Further
                 research is needed to determine the maximum
                 bioremediation capacity of this species and to evaluate
                 the lipid content and fatty acid profiles of P.
                 gualpensis to determine its potential application in
                 aquaculture feed.",

                 essential negative regulators that modulate cytokine
                 signaling and play key roles in numerous biological
                 processes, including immune responses. In this study,
                 we cloned the complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of two
                 SOCS genes, designated as Lv SOCS6 and Lv SOCS7, from
                 the whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. Lv SOCS6
                 encoded a polypeptide of 463 amino acids (aas),
                 spanning 1392 base pairs (bps), while Lv SOCS7 encoded
                 a significantly larger polypeptide of 955 aas,
                 encompassing 2868 bps. Both Lv SOCS proteins exhibited
                 conserved domains associated with SOCS, including a
                 centralized Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a
                 C-terminal SOCS box. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
                 that the deduced aa sequences of Lv SOCS6 and Lv SOCS7
                 clustered within the invertebrate type I SOCS family,
                 indicating their evolutionary relatedness. Tissue
                 distribution analysis demonstrated ubiquitous
                 expression of both Lv SOCS genes across all examined
                 tissues, with Lv SOCS6 showing heightened expression in
                 the gills and Lv SOCS7 in the gills and stomach.
                 Notably, mRNA expression patterns of Lv SOCS genes
                 following LPS and poly (I:C) stimulations exhibited
                 significant upregulations, while PGN stimulation
                 yielded incongruous results across the examined
                 tissues. Interestingly, concurrent with the diminished
                 expression of Lv SOCS6 and Lv SOCS7, there was
                 significant elevation in mRNA expression levels of Lv
                 STAT, a vital component of the Janus kinase
                 (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
                 (STAT) pathway. These findings shed light on the
                 potential involvement of the newly discovered type I
                 SOCS genes in regulating the JAK/STAT pathways and
                 playing pivotal roles in orchestrating the innate

                 important species found in the East Sea; along the
                 southern coast of Korea; south of Hokkaido, Japan;
                 around Taiwan; and in the East China sea. In Korea,
                 these two species hold high value, particularly on Jeju
                 Island. These species have similar appearances, and it
                 is challenging to distinguish them, particularly during
                 the seed period. We detected genetic differences in the
                 mtDNA (COI gene) of G. punctata and G. leonina, which
                 are morphologically indistinguishable, and developed
                 species-specific genetic markers for their
                 identification. In total, 16 and 4 haplotypes of the
                 COI genes were obtained from G. punctata (n = 164) and
                 G. leonina (n = 36), respectively. The haplotype
                 diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (Pi, \%) of the
                 COI were 0.359 and 0.054 for G. punctata and 0.560 and
                 0.078 for G. leonina, respectively. We designed a
                 Girella species common primer (control) and
                 species-specific primer sets (experimental) for the two
                 species. Amplicon sizes of 991, 579, and 391 bp were
                 obtained for common primers of the two Girella species
                 G. punctata and G. leonina. To confirm multiple targets
                 in a single reaction, multiplex PCR conditions were
                 optimized to adjust its resolution and accuracy. The
                 detection levels of the multiplex PCR were confirmed to
                 be 0.01 ng/{\SGMLmicro}L for the two Girella species.
                 The multiplex PCR was not associated with
                 cross-reactivity between G. punctata and G. leonina.
                 This multiplex species-specific PCR method provides a
                 simple and rapid technique for the identification of
                 two Girella species, thus increasing the efficiency and

                 OPC, respectiviely. After the fish were fed the trial
                 diets for 77 days, the intestinal samples were taken,
                 and the related parameters of intestinal health were
                 analyzed. Dietary 300 mg/kg or 600 mg/kg OPC could
                 reverse the decreased activities of lipase, protease,
                 and glutathione peroxidase and the level of total
                 antioxidant capacity, the increased intestinal
                 malondialdehyde and D-lactate acid levels and the
                 activity of diamine oxidase in serum, and the decreased
                 villus height caused by a high level of dietary
                 histamine. There were no significant differences above
                 all the indices between the H + OPC I group and the H +
                 OPC II group. The higher relative abundances of
                 potentially pathogenic bacteria were induced by the
                 high level of dietary histamine. Dietary 300 mg/kg OPC
                 might increase the relative abundance of the potential
                 probiotics and inhibit the colonization of intestinal
                 pathogenic bacteria of juvenile American eels exposed
                 to the stress of high dietary hisatamine. The
                 intestinal health status of the H + OPC groups was
                 similar to that of the control group. These results
                 suggested that dietary 300 mg/kg OPC might alleviate
                 the detrimental effects of dietary 534 mg/kg histamine
                 on the intestine health of juvenile American eels by
                 increasing the activity of digestive enzymes, improving
                 the antioxidative potential and barrier function, and
                 beneficially modulating the intestinal microbiota.
                 Dietary 600 mg/kg OPC could not exert further
                 improvement in growth performance and the intestinal
                 health of juvenile American eels.",

                 of the Atlantic Goliath Grouper Epinephelus itajara off
                 the coasts of Florida (USA) makes it difficult to
                 estimate the extent of their population recovery
                 following the 1990 fishery closure, as well as the
                 potential effects of the recent (2023) opening of a
                 fishery for juveniles. Goliath Grouper from the
                 Atlantic coast of Florida were non-lethally sampled for
                 size (total length, TL), age (via fin rays), and sex
                 and reproductive stage (via gonad biopsies, milt/egg
                 expression, gonopores) from May to October 2010--2016.
                 Of 653 unique fish captured (not including 118
                 recaptures), 257 (39.4\%) were females (122--228 cm TL;
                 5--20 years old), 264 (40.0\%) were males (104--225 cm
                 TL; 4--22 years old), 100 (15.3\%) were unsexed
                 (82--211 cm TL; 3--15 years old), and 32 (4.9\%) were
                 protogynous hermaphrodites (108--209 cm TL; 5--20 years
                 old). Protogyny was conclusively determined in two fish
                 recaptured and re-biopsied that had transitioned from
                 female to male. However, an overlap in the age and size
                 of males and females, a 1:1 sex ratio, and the presence
                 of relatively small, young, mature males, in
                 combination with an apparently low functional sex
                 change rate, all indicated that the sexual pattern of
                 Goliath Grouper was functionally gonochoristic with the
                 potential for diandric protogyny. Females {$>$} 10
                 years old were larger-at-age than males, and Goliath
                 Grouper from the Atlantic coast were larger-at-age than
                 fish from the Gulf of Mexico. These differences in age,
                 growth, and reproductive strategy --- as well as the

                 closely so that the current and future reproductive
                 capacity of the population continues to ensure growth
                 and sustainability.",

                 displaying a complex pattern of morphological and
                 life-history variation, contributing to taxonomic
                 confusion. Three main mitochondrial lineages (Adriatic,
                 Mediterranean, and marmoratus) developed during the
                 Pleistocene climatic events in the southern Alpine
                 ecosystem. Here, the natural distribution of native
                 brown trout S. trutta is controversial, complicated by
                 introductions of the Atlantic strain. By investigating
                 museum vouchers, this study aimed to retrace the
                 historical presence of brown trout in the southern
                 Alpine ecosystem before the beginning of mass
                 introductions, which occurred since the middle of the

                 historical and current genetic variability, this study
                 aims to depict the actual impact of introductions of
                 the introduced strain, increasing knowledge and
                 informing conservation strategies and future management

                 sequencing of the mitochondrial control region and (ii)
                 genotyping of the nuclear gene LDH-C1 *. Vouchers dated
                 the presence of the native Adriatic strain since 1821,
                 while current genetic variability showed the widespread
                 signature of introgression, a consequence of several
                 decades of introductions. Focused plans to preserve
                 local lineages are urgently needed, including
                 short-term solution to avoid complete pauperization of

                 indices. However, growth performance and somatic
                 indices in M. cephalus were not affected by the
                 experimental diets. Plasma samples from S. aurata fed
                 the microalgal diet revealed higher levels of glucose

                 aquatic environment setting of high-risk bivalve

                 (catalase, CuSOD and mt10) along with the lipid
                 peroxidation levels and activity levels of antioxidant
                 enzymes (catalase, SOD and glutathione reductase);
                 Results: Our results exhibited increased levels of all
                 these biomarkers. This increase was intensified in the
                 Marteilia infected individuals; Conclusions: Our
                 findings shed light on the oxidative and antioxidant
                 status of farmed mussels led to mortality in the
                 context of Marteilia infection. The latter is augmented
                 by the synergistic effect of heatwaves causing a
                 significant increase in oxidative damage and subsequent
                 antioxidant defense.",

  abstract =     "Southern swordtail fishes, which belong to the
                 viviparous teleosts called Xiphophorus, are unique
                 models for studies of evolution of sex chromosomes.
                 Monofactorial sex-determining systems, with either the
                 male or the female being the heterogametic sex, as well
                 as sex determination involving more than two sex
                 chromosomes, are found in swordtails and related
                 species. Some swordtail species seem to have originated
                 by crossing between two closely related species.
                 Although the sword has disappeared in many Xiphophorus
                 species during evolution, females of non-sworded
                 species still prefer sworded males, demonstrating a
                 discrepancy between natural and sexual selection.
                 Natural sex change has not been documented sufficiently
                 convincingly in swordtails, but, at least in some
                 subspecies, two or more male phenotypes exist. In a
                 laboratory experiment performed for over 30 years, it
                 has been observed that sex-determining genes may be
                 translocated from one chromosome to another in hybrids
                 of these evolutionary young species. While the factors
                 suggested to play central roles in sex determination
                 and differentiation, e.g., Dmrt1 and AMH, are highly
                 conserved during evolution, several master determining
                 factors have been detected in teleosts.
                 Endocrine-induced sex reversal has been demonstrated in
                 the guppy Poecilia reticulata, another viviparous fish.
                 In swordtails (X. helleri), endocrine disruptors such
                 as nonylphenol and bisphenol A may cause testis cell
                 degeneration and the inhibition of spermatogenesis.
                 Furthermore, swordtails are very easy to breed in
                 freshwater aquaria and, therefore, may be good models
                 for studying the factors influencing sex determination
                 and male differentiation.",

                 effects, such as delays in preservation, can lead to
                 inaccurate reproductive assessments. Therefore, it is
                 important to understand the differences between
                 handling effects and natural ovarian atresia. Seven
                 treatments of various holding temperatures and times to
                 preservation were applied to whole fish and extracted
                 ovaries of three tropical deepwater snapper species.
                 Ovarian post-mortem degradation was observed at 12 h at
                 ambient temperature and after 48 h iced or refrigerated
                 for both whole fish and extracted ovaries; however,
                 degradation did not adversely affect correct
                 reproductive phase classification in fishes stored in
                 ice from 12 to 48 h post-capture. A clear histological
                 indicator of post-mortem degradation was the breakdown
                 of ooplasm organelles at the oocyte periphery observed
                 in vitellogenic and cortical alveolar oocytes. However,
                 the chorion typically remains intact during post-mortem
                 degradation, in contrast to natural atresia. Effects on
                 post-ovulatory follicles were most discernible after 96
                 h on ice or refrigeration. Freezing gonadal tissue
                 resulted in drastic changes to oocyte shape and
                 morphology, making reproductive phase classification
                 challenging. We advise that (1) freezing ovaries should
                 be avoided where possible, and (2) gonad tissue should
                 ideally be preserved immediately but no later than 48 h

                 and fish passage structures are a useful conservation
                 tool to reconnect fragmented systems. The design of
                 fish passage structures is a tradeoff between the area
                 available for construction, slope, and costs associated
                 with the structure. The Longrie--Fecteau fish passage
                 structure was designed to be modular, adjustable to
                 barrier-specific needs, and to have a low slope (2\%)
                 to pass small-bodied fishes. We evaluated fish passage
                 through this structure in Fountain Creek, Colorado,
                 USA, via a PIT tag mark--recapture study. We documented
                 four native Great Plains fish species successfully
                 ascending the passage structure, with most passage
                 occurring at night. We estimated a 3\% probability of a
                 released fish entering the structure, then 89\% and
                 99\% passage to the midpoint and exit of the 123 m
                 structure, respectively. Low entrance efficiency was
                 due to low recapture probability of small-bodied study
                 organisms in a relatively large system, and the low
                 percentage of space of the entryway on this barrier
                 ({$<$3}\% of the length of the barrier). Fish that
                 entered the structure ascended quickly, with median
                 time for successful ascent of 19 min, and minimum time
                 of 6 min. The Longrie--Fecteau fish passage structure
                 is a conservation tool that may broaden the adoption of
                 fish passage structures for small-bodied fishes due to
                 its modularity and low slope.",

  abstract =     "The eastern Mediterranean Sea is one of the most
                 invaded marine ecosystems due to the introduction of
                 Lessepsian species, which migrated from the Red Sea to
                 the Mediterranean Sea following the construction of the
                 Suez Canal. Some of these species may initially appear
                 to be beneficial for fisheries by providing additional
                 income sources for fishers; however, this usually
                 occurs at the expense of negatively impacted native
                 species and, thus, the ecosystem, which leads to
                 greater economic losses for the fisheries in the long
                 term. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the impact
                 of N. randalli, which is one of the Lessepsian species
                 with increasing commercial importance for the
                 fisheries, on the food web dynamics in a coastal
                 ecosystem in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea using a
                 mass-balance food web modelling approach by
                 capitalising on field data obtained from trawl
                 samplings conducted within the scope of the study.
                 Results showed that the ecosystem was in a
                 developmental stage and experienced an autotrophic
                 succession. The keystone fish group with a structuring
                 role in the food web was sea breams and porgies.
                 Although N. randalli had positive impacts on certain
                 commercially exploited indigenous demersal fish species
                 by mitigating the negative impact of another Lessepsian
                 species, i.e., Saurida undosquamis (Richardson, 1848),
                 in the food web, it had a negative impact on the
                 keystone group of the food web, i.e., sea breams and
                 porgies. Therefore, N. randalli poses a potential
                 threat to the ecosystem's structure, and the
                 interactions of N. randalli with other species in the
                 food web may instigate an ecosystem reorganisation in
                 the future. We suggest targeted fisheries exploitation
                 and incentives for the fishery of N. randalli as
                 management strategies to mitigate its negative impacts.
                 However, the mitigating role of N. randalli in
                 regulating the negative impacts of S. undosquamis could

                 a scientific trawl survey of Bulgarian Black Sea waters
                 in the autumn of 2020. Turbot is among the most
                 valuable fish species in the Black Sea, and thornback
                 ray is a sensitive cartilaginous species with a
                 significantly declining abundance throughout the
                 Mediterranean region. The stock biomass of turbot was
                 estimated at 1467.6 tons, with a relative abundance of
                 896,922 individuals, and those of the thornback ray
                 were 1187.9 tons and 519,606 individuals, respectively.
                 Mean turbot abundance, interpolated into {0.5$^\circ $}
                 latitude/longitude grid cells, ranged between 52 and

                 biodiversity, relatively few countries have enacted
                 national endangered and threatened species legislation.
                 Tailoring an adequate legislative framework with clear
                 objectives and regulations consistent with the
                 available scientific evidence is fundamental for the
                 effective conservation of marine endangered and
                 threatened species. This paper analyzes the legal
                 framework and current institutional tools for the
                 conservation of marine endangered and threatened
                 species in the Russian Federation. In this regard,
                 important legislative tools include federal laws, as
                 well as internationally binding signed agreements,
                 among others, such as the Convention on International
                 Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
                 (CITES) and the Convention on Wetlands of International
                 Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar). A
                 strategy and an action plan for the conservation of
                 biological diversity were also developed. Besides, the
                 most important tool for the conservation and protection
                 of marine endangered and threatened species is the Red
                 Book of the Russian Federation (RBRF) and other
                 regional Red Books. Responsibility for causing harm to
                 the species listed in the RBRF and their habitat is
                 specified in the code of administrative offenses and
                 the criminal code of the Russian Federation. Finally,
                 conclusions and identified gaps were highlighted in the
                 last section, including, among other things, that
                 legislation is still limited in how it takes the
                 impacts of climate change into account. Such type of
                 study is highly recommended, considering the relatively
                 few number of papers dedicated to the study of the
                 impact and/or implications of the conservation tools
                 and strategies mentioned in this paper on the status of

                 largest reef fish in the Western Atlantic, exhibit high
                 site fidelity to home reefs but also undertake annual
                 migrations to distant spawning sites. Once relatively
                 common throughout Florida and the Caribbean, the
                 species; is now considered vulnerable (i.e., threatened
                 with extinction) due to overfishing and loss of
                 juvenile mangrove habitat. Goliath grouper in the
                 southeastern US form annual spawning aggregations on
                 high-relief reefs located offshore of both the Gulf and
                 Atlantic coasts of Florida, US. To determine spawning
                 site fidelity and describe migration patterns to
                 aggregations, we implanted 50 adult goliath grouper
                 with acoustic transmitter tags from 2010 to 2013. Fish
                 were tagged at known spawning sites off the Florida
                 Atlantic coast and tracked as they moved through the
                 FACT Network array of acoustic receivers. From 2010 to
                 2020, we collected $ \approx $7 million detections from
                 tagged goliath grouper at 153 sites along the
                 southeastern US Atlantic coast. Results of this
                 long-term tracking indicate that adult goliath grouper
                 are relatively sedentary during non-spawning months
                 (Nov to June) but move significantly more prior to,
                 during, and immediately after spawning (July to Oct).
                 Inter-annual spawning site fidelity was high: between
                 80--93\% of tagged fish returned to the same spawning
                 sites each year. Arrival timing at spawning sites
                 coincided with the August new moon, with males arriving
                 earlier than females. Some individuals migrated
                 distances greater than 400-km per year, with observed
                 migration rates of up to 44-km per day prior to
                 spawning. Long-term tagging data are critical for
                 understanding movement patterns and developing
                 management strategies for this species of special

                 visceral white spot disease in marine fish, which
                 usually occurs at 16--19 {$^\circ $}C and has resulted
                 in heavy economic losses. Our previous RNA sequencing
                 revealed that the expression of the fliL gene in P.
                 plecoglossicida was significantly up-regulated during
                 infection of the host. In order to study the influence
                 of the fliL gene on the virulence of P.
                 plecoglossicida, the fliL gene of the NZBD9 strain was
                 knocked out by the homologous recombination method, the
                 fliL gene-deleted strain ({\Delta} fliL strain)
                 constructed, and complemented the fliL gene to the
                 {\Delta} fliL strain to obtain the C-{\Delta} fliL
                 strain. The growth curves of the NZBD9 strain, {\Delta}
                 fliL strain, and C-{\Delta} fliL strain did not show
                 significant differences. Compared with the NZBD9
                 strain, the motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation
                 ability were tendered in the {\Delta} fliL strain (p

                 CFU/fish, respectively. RNA sequencing was performed on
                 wild-type strains and {\Delta} fliL strains. A total of
                 126 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened
                 (p {$<$} 0.05), of which 114 were downregulated and 12

                 the six-type secretion system and transport activity
                 were significantly downregulated. The DEGs were aligned
                 to the GO and KEGG databases and enriched to 44 GO
                 pathways and 39 KEGG pathways, respectively. The active
                 pathways of ABC transporters were significantly
                 enriched in both databases. These results indicate that
                 the fliL gene is related to the movement, biofilm

                 role in the growth and health of aquatic animal hosts
                 and have drawn increasing attention. However, the role
                 of the intestinal microbiota in the growth of
                 freshwater prawns remains unclear. Here, the intestinal
                 microbiota of freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium
                 rosenbergii) at different life stages (one, two, and
                 three months old) were investigated using 16S rRNA
                 sequencing. The results showed that community richness
                 and diversity increased with growth, which might be one
                 of the reasons that the prawns maintained a fast growth
                 rate before sexual maturation. Three core phyla were
                 identified in the one-month-old group, namely,
                 Firmicutes (79.24\%), Proteobacteria (17.09\%) and
                 Actinobacteriota (2.01\%). Five core phyla were
                 identified in the two-month-old group, including
                 Firmicutes (47.84\%), Proteobacteria (44.22\%),
                 Actinobacteriota (1.83\%), Acidobacteriota (1.66\%) and
                 Bacteroidota (1.24\%), and the core phyla in the
                 three-month-old group were similar, except for
                 Acidobacterota, which was not identified. A total of 12
                 core genera were identified in all samples, and
                 significant differences were observed in the relative
                 abundance of gut microbiota between the three groups (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). Exiguobacterium, Lactococcus and
                 Shewanella were the three most significantly
                 differentially abundant genera between stages. In
                 addition, Candidatus Hepatoplasma was detected only in
                 the two- and three-month-old prawn groups. This study

  abstract =     "Fishing sector fuel subsidies are designed to increase
                 profitability by reducing costs. However, despite the
                 number of liters of fuel subsidized in 2018 in Mexico,
                 there is no information available on the effectiveness
                 of the subsidies in reducing cost inefficiencies. The
                 purpose of this study was to estimate the cost
                 efficiency of shrimp fishing companies in Mexico, as
                 well as measure the impact of fuel subsidies on the
                 cost inefficiency of the sector from 2003 to 2018. The
                 True Fixed Effects model was used to represent a
                 Cobb--Douglas stochastic production frontier, which
                 included a shrimp fishing inefficiencies model. The
                 results indicate that shrimp fishing companies could
                 reduce their costs by 25\% without reducing their catch
                 levels. Fishing companies in the Gulf of Mexico were
                 more efficient than those operating in the Gulf of
                 California and the South Pacific. Fuel subsidies reduce
                 cost inefficiencies, with a greater effect when the
                 subsidy reaches a level of 20\% of the total liters of
                 subsidized fuel.",

  abstract =     "Thermal refuges are becoming increasingly influential
                 for dictating the population status and spatial
                 distribution of cold-water stenotherm salmonids in the
                 mid- to southern extent of their range. The global
                 climate is predicted to continue to warm, and
                 therefore, the overall thermal suitability of
                 freshwater habitats for stream salmonids is predicted
                 to decline in concert. However, stream and river
                 thermal heterogeneity will offer considerable
                 resiliency for these populations. Thermal refuges are
                 formed by many physical processes; common natural
                 refuges include cold tributary plumes, groundwater
                 springs, alcoves, and hyporheic upwellings. However,
                 many anthropogenically formed refuges (such as
                 stratified reservoirs or cold-water tailrace outflows)
                 also exist in hydropower-regulated rivers. The
                 significance of these refuges to stream salmonids
                 depends on their size and temperature differential, but
                 also other habitat characteristics such as their depth,
                 flow velocity, Froude number, and many biotic factors
                 within the refuges. Modern technologies such as
                 drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras and other remote
                 sensing techniques allow for the efficient
                 identification of such refuges, and inexpensive options
                 include the identification of refuges during ice cover
                 using orthophotographs. Behavioural thermoregulation,
                 i.e., salmonids aggregating in cold-water refuges, can
                 be either facultative or obligate and the timing of
                 these events is governed by life stage, species, and
                 population-specific physiologically regulated
                 cumulative thresholds that are inherently related to
                 the recent thermal history, or hysteresis, of each
                 individual. Salmonids appear to have an excellent
                 spatial cognition for locating and relocating
                 cold-water refuges, and their spatial distribution is
                 largely affected by the availability of the cold-water
                 refuges during the warm-water period in many thermally
                 stressed rivers. Gregarious behaviour is the norm for
                 salmonid fishes within the thermal refuges; however,
                 the size/microhabitat hierarchy appears to dictate the
                 within-refuge distribution at the micro-scale. There
                 continues to be a great impetus for protecting---and in
                 carefully determined cases creating---cold-water
                 refuges in the future. A thorough understanding of what
                 a ``goldilocks'' refuge is for various salmonids and
                 their different life stages will be imperative as
                 cold-water restoration is gaining popularity. Finally,
                 disentangling the roles of the climate-induced and
                 landscape activity-induced warming potential of fluvial
                 freshwater will be important to ensure continued
                 environmentally responsible landscape activities in
                 future waterscapes.",

                 three-dimensional numerical model for freezing tuna of

                 combined with an analysis of the freezing process of
                 tuna. This paper also studied the effect of air
                 velocity, temperature, and tuna size on the freezing

                 tracers used to elucidate an organism's diet and

                 isotope turnover rates and trophic discrimination
                 factors in four different tissues (liver, digestive
                 tissue, muscle, and skin) with variable metabolic
                 activity in winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes

                 resulting in similar turnovers in {\delta} 15 N but

                 Turnovers in both {\delta} 15 N and {\delta} 13 C were

                 to evaluate its novel anti-fungal effect via an
                 experimental and docking study. FHP has high protein
                 (30.25\%) and lipid (5.12\%) content and a diversity of
                 elements, which suggests that FHP is a potential
                 substrate for microbial fermentation. Serratia
                 marcescens TNU01 was screened as the most effective
                 strain to produce PG from FHP. Further experiments
                 indicated that the combination of FHP and crude chitin
                 at the ratio of 9/1 and used at 1.5\% as a C/N source

                 (type of 14 L) achieved the highest PG yield production
                 (6.4 mg/mL) in a short cultivation time (10 h) in
                 comparison with the highest PG yield (5.8 mg/mL)

                 solani F04. The molecular docking results also showed
                 that PG effectively interacted with targeting protein
                 3QPC of F. solani with good binding energy (DS---9.2
                 kcal/mol) and an acceptable RMSD value (0.94 {\AA}). In

                 alternative is attracting attention for boosting
                 biosecurity with minimal water exchange and reduced
                 feed intake. BFT relies on applying organic carbon to
                 maintain a high C/N ratio above 10, which allows
                 heterotrophs to assimilate toxic nitrogen. A high
                 percentage of carbon loss is thus generated from BFT.
                 For this review, a thorough search of the relevant
                 literature was conducted to gather valuable information
                 on the optimization of carbon utilization. The keywords
                 searched included `BFT', `carbon use efficiency',
                 `carbon conversion', `carbon retention', `carbon
                 emission', `carbon loss', and `carbon release'. The
                 current review discusses the possible effects of
                 various C/N ratios, carbon types, addition strategies,
                 and technology integration with respect to the
                 optimized carbon utilization in BFT. Given the extreme
                 lack of accessible research, it was concluded that the
                 carbon utilization in BFT is still in its initial
                 research stage. Anyhow, this review sheds light on
                 plausible approaches for boosted carbon utilization by
                 adopting slow-release carbon, reducing carbon input,
                 integrating with other technologies, and enhancing
                 interactions between functional microbes within BFT,

                 for sampling freshwater fishes. However, little is
                 known about the catch efficiency of the net. This
                 research investigated the catch efficiency of a
                 multi-mesh trammel net (nominal mesh size; 10.0, 30.0,
                 50.0, and 70.0 mm) for fish sampling in the Yangtze
                 River of China. Catch composition and factors affecting
                 catch per unit effort based on fish number (CPUE N),
                 weight (CPUE W), and species number (CPUE S) were
                 analyzed. The results showed that the net was capable
                 of capturing a wide range of fish sizes (total length,
                 5.5 to 121.0 cm) and species (n = 50). Increasing soak
                 time from 9.4 to 24.0 h resulted in a decrease in CPUE
                 N and CPUE W while a longer soak time increased CPUE S.
                 CPUE N, CPUE W, and CPUE S varied significantly with
                 fishing locations. The net provides a potential
                 complement to the current fish sampling techniques used
                 in freshwater ecosystems (e.g., large rivers, lakes,
                 and reservoirs). The findings of this research help to
                 improve our understanding of the catch efficiency of
                 the multi-mesh trammel net and provides insight into
                 better designs for gears and methods for sampling

                 stressors, including increasing pesticide run-off
                 driven by precipitation and irrigation. Pyrethroids are
                 the fourth major group of insecticides in use worldwide
                 and have extremely negative effects on aquatic fauna.
                 In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of an
                 acute 2 h sub-lethal exposure to different levels of
                 the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on the swimming behaviour
                 of two Cypriniformes species: the native Iberian barbel
                 (Luciobarbus bocagei) and the non-native invasive bleak
                 (Alburnus alburnus). The experimental set-up consisted
                 of previous exposure to three esfenvalerate
                 concentrations (control, 1.2 (low), and 2.0 (high)
                 {\mu}g/L) before being stocked in a
                 three-artificial-flume-channel mesocosm for behavioural
                 trials through direct observation. Monitored behaviours
                 included (i) routine activity, (ii) shoal cohesion, and
                 (iii) boldness. Significant differences in fish
                 behaviour were detected for the native species
                 (barbel), as individuals spent significantly more time
                 holding position (i.e., resting) in the control
                 (44.9\%) than in the high esfenvalerate concentration
                 (25.2\%). Concordantly, control barbels were also found
                 to perform more directional changes than the ones
                 exposed to high esfenvalerate concentrations.
                 Behavioural changes were also found for boldness,
                 measured by the proportion of fish attempts to
                 negotiate the upstream ramp, which were significantly
                 higher in the control (37.4\%) and in the high
                 concentration (41.5\%) compared to the low one
                 (21.1\%). Finally, regarding shoal cohesion of the
                 barbel, it was tighter in the control (81.3\%) than in
                 the low- (70.5\%) and high- (71.1\%) esfenvalerate
                 treatments. For the invasive bleak, there were no
                 significant differences in any of the behavioural
                 traits upon previous exposure to an increasing
                 esfenvalerate concentration. This experimental study
                 demonstrated that even short-term exposure to the
                 pyrethroid esfenvalerate was sufficient to alter the
                 behaviour of a native Cypriniformes fish species while
                 not affecting the non-native species. This may confer
                 greater competitive advantages to non-native fish

                 acceptable, with restricting recreational fishing and
                 spatial closures the least supported management options
                 for both species, in addition to maximum size limits
                 for crabs. These views were not always consistent
                 across fishing locations for each species and among
                 types of crab fishers, indicating heterogeneity in
                 views. Stocking was the most acceptable of the
                 management measures not already utilised for crabs and
                 among the most popular for bream fisheries.
                 Recreational fishers of both species believed stock
                 enhancement could have strong positive outcomes for the
                 abundance of their target species and increase their
                 subsequent catches. They also recognized that some
                 negative outcomes, e.g., increased fishing pressure and
                 environmental issues, might occur but considered them
                 unlikely.",

                 organisms that catalyze transfer reactions between
                 amino acids and keto acids, crucial for amino acid
                 metabolism and synthesis. Aminotransferase classes I
                 and II play a vital role in regulating osmolarity,
                 protecting cells, and improving metabolic homeostasis
                 and cellular fitness. To investigate the
                 characteristics of the aminotransferase class I and II
                 gene family and their roles in osmotic pressure
                 regulation in the Jinjiang oyster (Crassostrea
                 ariakensis), the gene structure, chromosomal
                 localization, and phylogeny were characterized and the
                 genes' expression in the gill under high-salt stress
                 was analyzed. In this study, eighteen Aminotransferase
                 class I and II genes, including SPTLCa and SPTLCb, SPTa
                 and SPTb, ALAT2a and ALAT2b, KAT3a and KAT3b, and ASTa,
                 ASTb and ASTc, were identified. The physicochemical
                 properties of 11 family members were stable, with their
                 instability factors less than 40. Subcellular
                 localization prediction showed that aminotransferase
                 classes I and II were localized in the cytoplasm or
                 mitochondria. Chromosomal localization results showed
                 that the 18 aminotransferase class I and II genes were
                 located on eight chromosomes. All members of this gene
                 family had the Aminotran_1_2 structural domain which is
                 associated with osmotic pressure regulation by
                 adjusting the conversion reaction between amino acids
                 and keto acids. Most gene expressions showed an initial
                 increase followed by a decrease from 0 h to 12 h when
                 the oysters were challenged by acute stress using
                 artificial seawater with a salinity of 40. However, the
                 expression of CarAGT2 and CarKAT3b genes showed an
                 increased trend with increasing stress time. This study

                 gene family in C. ariakensis and their role in osmotic
                 pressure regulation, which provides scientific data for
                 understanding the potential functions of these genes in

                 waters of the Amur River in China, this study
                 investigated the status of juvenile chum salmon
                 resources and their basic biological characteristics in
                 the Amur River and the Ussuri River in China. The
                 results showed that the average catch per unit effort

                 ind{\cdot}10 {$-$3} m 3 for the Ussuri River. Chum
                 salmon migrate downstream, mainly in mid-May in the
                 Amur River and in early May in the Ussuri River, and no
                 fish was caught in the rivers after June. Most chum
                 salmon migrated when the water was between 10 and 14
                 {$^\circ $}C. The average FL (fork length) and BW (body

  abstract =     "Salmon lice are one of the biggest challenges to
                 sustainable salmonid aquaculture. The species display
                 high evolutionary potential, which is evident by its
                 development of resistance to numerous chemical
                 compounds used for delousing. In response to this,
                 salmon farms now use non-chemical delousing methods to
                 minimize the damage done by salmon lice, including
                 heavy reliance on cleaner fish. Anecdotal reports from
                 farmers and fish health personnel in areas where
                 cleaner fish are used have suggested that salmon lice
                 are becoming less pigmented, potentially making them
                 harder for cleaner fish to visually detect. This
                 experiment investigated changes in the pigmentation of
                 salmon lice in relation to the use of cleaner fish,
                 louse stage and sex, temperature, preferred salmon
                 swimming depth, daylength, and salinity. Salmon lice
                 were sampled from snorkel cages on a commercial salmon
                 farm where three cages were stocked with farmed
                 lumpfish and ballan wrasse, and three cages were
                 without cleaner fish. Water temperature, salinity, and
                 depth were recorded using a conductivity, temperature,
                 and depth recorder. Pigmentation was measured via
                 photographic analysis of individual lice. Although
                 louse pigmentation varied considerably throughout the
                 experiment, using cleaner fish throughout a single
                 production cycle did not reduce average louse
                 pigmentation compared to control cages. On average,
                 male lice were significantly darker pigmented than
                 females, but otherwise there were no patterns in louse
                 pigmentation in relation to life stage, salinity,
                 temperature, or daylength. Salmon lice exhibit a high
                 degree of evolvability and have become resistant to
                 every chemical removal treatment developed thus far.
                 The present data suggest that, with the densities and
                 species of cleaner fish commonly used in commercial
                 salmon production, there is not strong directional
                 selection on louse pigmentation. Lice, at least with
                 regard to visual appearance, are not likely to adapt in
                 a way which reduces cleaner fish efficacy anytime
                 soon.",

                 as an immune stimulant and antioxidant in fish for
                 several years. A. membranaceus was decocted and mixed

  abstract =     "While few have contemplated the potential impacts of
                 climate change on small-scale fisheries and fishermen
                 in the Colombian Pacific, understanding these effects
                 is crucial for devising effective adaptation
                 strategies. This study presents the outcomes of a
                 vulnerability assessment related to climate change for
                 fishermen in the Colombian South Pacific. The
                 assessment employed a multivariable model that
                 considered the sensitivity of marine and coastal
                 ecosystems that support fishing resources alongside
                 fishermen's adaptability to changes in the biophysical
                 environment. Socioeconomic factors were also
                 scrutinized. The study revealed that 80\% of the
                 surveyed fishermen are at a medium to high level of
                 vulnerability due to changes in the distribution of key
                 commercial species, which influences the productivity
                 of their traditional fishing sites. Their vulnerability
                 is primarily attributed to low usage of fishing
                 technologies, the boat engine's limited propulsion
                 capacity, and a lack of diversity and sustainability in
                 fishing gear. These elements increase their reliance on
                 fishing sites close to the coast (approximately 3 km to
                 5 km from the shoreline), resulting in a low adaptive
                 capacity for the fishermen. The dominant factor driving
                 the sensitivity component was the economic significance
                 of the fishing gear and the fact that the gear could be
                 more diverse and durable. These findings provide a
                 critical scientific basis for assessing the fishing
                 sector's vulnerability to climate change and informing
                 future collaborative decision-making in managing
                 small-scale fisheries in the Colombian South Pacific

                 to establish bacterial etiological agents associated
                 with fish mortality and to determine their antibiotic
                 susceptibility. A total of 300 fish samples from 11
                 farms were aseptically collected and bacteria were
                 isolated from the kidney, liver, brain, and spleen. The
                 isolates were identified using their morphological
                 characteristics and conventional biochemical tests. The
                 antibiotic susceptibility of selected bacteria was
                 determined by the Kirby--Bauer disc diffusion method.
                 The following well-known fish pathogens were identified
                 at a prevalence of Aeromonas spp. (13\%), Pseudomonas
                 spp. (10.3\%), Micrococcus spp. (9.7\%), Klebsiella

                 spp. (7.0\%), and Acinetobacter spp. (7.0\%). All the
                 isolates tested were susceptible to doxycycline, and
                 complete resistance to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole,
                 and cephalothin was recorded in the Bacillus spp. The

                 and the first to determine the antibiotic
                 susceptibility of fish bacteria among small-scale farms

                 potentially reduce the fishing pressure on wild stocks
                 by the global aquarium trade, but its expansion is
                 often constrained by the limited understanding on the
                 biology and early life history of candidate species.
                 The orchid dottyback Pseudochromis fridmani is a
                 valuable and popular marine ornamental fish, but
                 scientific reports on its baseline biology, especially
                 the egg filial cannibalistic behaviour, are scarce. The
                 present study documented key aspects of reproductive
                 biology and early ontogeny of P. fridmani in captivity,
                 including reproductive behaviour, patterns of spawning
                 and filial cannibalism throughout a 12-month period by
                 seven pairs of brood fish, as well as the embryonic and
                 larval development. The results showed that the captive
                 spawning of the broodstock pairs generally occurred
                 every 5--11 days, most commonly every 6--8 days,
                 throughout a year. Despite feeding the brood fish to
                 satiation throughout the data collection period, the
                 average monthly rate of egg filial cannibalism reached
                 55 {\pm} 37\%, but the cannibalism frequency appeared
                 to be pair-specific. The egg incubation duration was
                 approximately 96 h at 27 {\pm} 1 {$^\circ $}C, and the
                 development of embryos from cleavage, blastula,
                 gastrula, and segmentation to the pharyngula stage is
                 herein described in detail. The newly hatched P.
                 fridmani larvae possessed important structures and
                 organs for first feeding, including pigmented eyes,
                 developed jaws, and a straight-tube gut. The 0 to 14
                 days post-hatching (DPH) period appeared to be an
                 important larval stage, as P. fridmani larvae were
                 observed to complete major changes in morphology, gut
                 development, and phototactic behaviour by 14 DPH. Under
                 the culture conditions of this study, the earliest
                 transition to the juvenile stage was observed on 31
                 DPH, and the majority of fish became juveniles by 56
                 DPH. The results of this study inform baseline
                 aquaculture production protocols and direct future
                 research, particularly to reduce filial cannibalism
                 through broodstock management and to improve larval
                 culture through supporting the early ontogenetic
                 development of P. fridmani. Additionally, these
                 findings form a foundation for further studying the
                 biology and ecology of P. fridmani in the wild.",

  abstract =     "The introduction of non-native freshwater fish is a
                 primary cause of aquatic biodiversity loss at global
                 scale. Such introductions have a severe impact on
                 freshwater ecosystems in terms of competition,
                 predation, habitat alteration, genetic pollution and
                 transmission of diseases and parasites. A systematic
                 review was conducted on the helminths parasites of
                 freshwater fish in the context of species introduction
                 and a total of 199 publications were retrieved between
                 1969 and November 2022. Several scenarios may arise
                 when a new fish species arrive in a recipient area.
                 Non-native fish hosts can co-introduce their parasites
                 without transmitting them to native fish (e.g., the
                 case of North American Centrarchidae and their
                 Monogenea parasites). Another possible outcome is the
                 transfer of these parasites to the native fish fauna
                 (spillover, e.g., the cases of the Nematoda
                 Anguillicola crassus Kuwahara, Niimi \& Itagaki, 1974
                 and the Monogenea Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957).
                 Reciprocally, non-native fish hosts may acquire
                 parasites in their new distribution range whether these
                 parasites are native or were previously introduced
                 (e.g., the cases of Ponto-Caspian Gobiidae and the
                 Chinese sleeper Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877).
                 Acquired parasites can then be spilled back to the
                 native fauna. This phenomenon is of particular interest
                 when non-native fish hosts influence the dynamics of
                 zoonotic parasites.",

                 initial body weight of 3.68 {\pm} 0.002 g were fed for
                 8 weeks on three experimental diets (isoproteic:
                 41.00\%; isolipidic: 7.61\%) that were formulated using
                 fish meal (FM), Chlorella sorokiniana (CHL), and
                 Clostridium autoethanogenum protein (CAP) as the
                 primary protein sources, respectively. This study
                 examined the growth, non-specific immunity, intestinal
                 digestion, and microbiota of L. vannamei after the
                 feeding experiment concluded. Compared to the FM group,
                 the findings indicate that the weight gain rate (WGR),
                 specific growth rate (SGR), and protein efficiency
                 ratio (PER) of L. vannamei were notably enhanced via
                 dietary CAP. The CHL group exhibited the highest levels
                 of catalase (CAT), phenoloxidase (PO), and superoxide
                 dismutase (SOD) activities in the gills of L. vannamei,
                 whereas the FM group had the lowest levels. Conversely,
                 the malondialdehyde (MDA) content showed the opposite
                 trend. Both dietary CHL and CAP promoted the digestive
                 enzyme activities of L. vannamei, with dietary CAP
                 having a more pronounced promotional effect. An
                 analysis of alpha diversity indicated that the
                 consumption of dietary CHL substantially enhanced the
                 abundance and diversity of microbiota in the intestinal
                 tract of L. vannamei. Furthermore, the dietary CHL
                 significantly increased the colonization of
                 immune-associated beneficial bacteria and inhibited the
                 colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal
                 tract of L. vannamei, whereas dietary CAP mainly

                 eastern Mediterranean is well-noted in the literature.
                 During the last decade in western Greek waters,
                 small-scale fisheries (SSF) catches exhibit increased
                 relative contribution of rabbitfishes, which have
                 originated from the Red Sea and inhabited the country's
                 southeastern part since the Second World War. This
                 study has used quantitative and qualitative information
                 to assess the short-term economic effect of the
                 rabbitfishes' expansion in the SSF m{\'e}tier targeting
                 the indigenous thermophilic parrotfish in the South
                 Ionian Sea. The short-term micro-level negative
                 economic effects of the rabbitfishes' invasion and the
                 corresponding adverse effects on fishers' economic
                 wealth have been estimated. The results indicate
                 attitudinal differences among fishers, although their
                 local ecological knowledge may enable them to avoid
                 rabbitfishes' hot spots and mitigate the respective
                 economic losses, that particularly for smaller SSF
                 vessels already seem to be quite important. As climate
                 warming may further facilitate the expansion of
                 rabbitfishes, outcompeting parrotfish, the latter
                 m{\'e}tier may eventually become economically
                 unsustainable. Fine-scale analysis at the m{\'e}tier
                 level enables addressing the specificities of
                 social-ecological systems and can contribute to
                 informed and more effective decision making related to

                 {\delta} 13 C is influenced by lipid content and often

                 of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), a highly
                 migratory finfish of considerable economic and
                 ecological value. Lipid extraction was conducted on
                 yellowfin tuna white muscle tissue (C:N range:

                 correction models for {\delta} 13 C were fitted and

                 for lipid correction of white muscle tissue for
                 {\delta} 13 C analysis in yellowfin tuna and similar

                 (0.0, 25, 50, 100 {\SGMLmicro}g/L) and sperm kinetics
                 were analyzed with a computer-assisted semen analysis
                 (CASA) system. In the second trial, 2 g of oocytes were
                 fertilized with 50 {\SGMLmicro}L of milt, activated
                 with contaminated water at different iHg concentrations
                 (0.0, 25, 50, 100 {\SGMLmicro}g/L), and maintained that
                 way during the first hour of incubation. Samples were
                 taken every 3--4 h until hatching to identify embryo
                 deformations. Fertilization and hatching rates were

                 and larvae eight days post-hatching (dph) was also

                 iHg concentrations (25, 50, 100 {\SGMLmicro}g/L) were

                 motility decreased (9.8--13.2\%) and the amount of
                 immotile sperm increased (3-fold) relative to values in
                 the control group. A significant increase in oocyte
                 diameter and a decrease in fertilization and hatching
                 rates were observed with the higher iHg concentrations
                 (50--100 {\SGMLmicro}g/L). Embryo deformations
                 ({$>$40}\%) such as scoliosis, lordosis, and
                 microcephaly were observed, as well as premature

                 {\SGMLmicro}g/L) relative to that in the control group.
                 The results suggest that bocachico semen, embryos, and

  abstract =     "The aquaculture production of pikeperch has reached
                 commercial scale in a number of European countries, but
                 the high mortality of early life cycle stages and minor
                 understanding of nutritional requirements are still
                 major bottlenecks. To investigate the fate of fatty
                 acids during early development, weaning and rearing,
                 pikeperch larvae and juveniles from a commercial
                 recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) were sampled
                 over 2 months for morphometric data, as well as fatty
                 acid composition, with a total of 6 sampling days, with
                 four to five replicates per sampling day and between 1
                 and 25 pikeperch larvae per individual sample,
                 depending on larval biomass. The biomass of sampled
                 pikeperch larvae varied from 0.1 to 420 mg (dry mass
                 DM), depending on the age of the larvae, and the
                 initial length of the pikeperch larvae was about 4.5
                 mm. Our data confirm that, accompanied by an
                 exponential increase in dry mass, total fatty acids
                 (TFAs) in larval tissues increased with the beginning
                 of exogenous feed uptake and were depleted between days
                 13 and 25 post hatch, most likely associated with the
                 weaning and metamorphosis of the larvae. We conclude
                 that all fatty acid classes may serve as metabolic fuel
                 during metamorphosis, but the ultimate fatty acid
                 composition is strongly impacted by the available feed.
                 The chosen diet probably caused a lack of
                 alpha-linolenic (18:3n-3; ALA) and docosahexaenoic acid
                 (22:6n-3; DHA) during larval development and a shortage
                 of vaccenic (18:1n-7), alpha-linolenic (18:3n-3; ALA)
                 and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6; ARA) in juvenile
                 pikeperch. This led to low DHA/EPA ratios 13 days post
                 hatch, a high EPA/ARA ratio at days 41 and 56 post
                 hatch and a fluctuating ratio of alpha-linolenic acid
                 to linoleic acid (18:2n-6; LA). A temporary lack of
                 essential fatty acids can cause dysfunctions and
                 eventually mortalities in pikeperch larvae and
                 juveniles. Despite high larval growth rates, the
                 biochemical composition of the first fed Artemia and
                 microdiets was most likely not sufficient and in need
                 of improvement. We suggest that deficiencies must be
                 compensated, e.g., through the substitution of the
                 offered Artemia with more suitable live feed organisms,
                 such as freshwater rotifers, and the enrichment of
                 current microdiets in order to prevent high mortalities
                 during pikeperch rearing and weaning.",

  abstract =     "Cryptobenthic fishes make up more than half of coral
                 reef fish fauna and contribute greatly to coral reef
                 trophodynamics and diversity. Because of their small
                 size, they are easily overlooked and understudied. Some
                 of them use corals as their habitat, but this
                 association is not well understood. In the Caribbean,
                 two common cryptobenthic gobies, Elacatinus evelynae
                 and Coryphopterus lipernes, are usually observed
                 residing on corals. In order to compare their habitat
                 use, we investigated their distributions on a range of
                 scleractinian host-coral species at three different
                 depths (5, 10, and 15 m) at Cura{\c{c}}ao, southern
                 Caribbean. The numbers of both species were relatively
                 low at 5 m. Furthermore, we investigated the
                 relationship between fish size and depth and found that
                 adult E. evelynae individuals were most common at 5 m
                 depth and juveniles at 15 m depth. Novel host corals
                 were found for both fish species. Taking host size into
                 account, the gobies were most abundant on large coral
                 colonies of two host species: E. evelynae on both
                 Colpophyllia natans and Montastraea cavernosa, and C.
                 lipernes only on C. natans. In summary, depth, host
                 species, and host-colony size were found to be
                 environmental factors that may determine the occurrence
                 of both fish species.",

                 improving sustainable fisheries management and
                 protecting vulnerable fish stocks. To identify
                 climate-related habitat changes and variations in the
                 distribution of fishing activity for squid-jigging
                 vessels in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, two types
                 (weighted arithmetic mean method, weighted-AMM;
                 weighted geometric mean method, weighted-GMM) of
                 habitat suitability index (HSI) models were developed
                 in this study with marine environmental data at
                 different depths. The boosted regression tree (BRT)
                 model was adopted to access the monthly important
                 environmental variables and the relative influence of
                 the corresponding variables. The results showed that
                 the weighted-AMM has better prediction performance than
                 the weighted-GMM. The suitable fishing areas showed
                 significant seasonal changes in both spatial location
                 and coverage area. The hotspot map showed that the
                 suitable fishing area for squid-jigging vessels was
                 located in the scope of 42 {\SGMLcompfn} N{\sim}44

                 {\SGMLcompfn} E throughout the year during
                 2012{\sim}2019, which suggests that high squid-jigging
                 fishing pressure should be given more attention in
                 fishery management. The HSI model also had good
                 prediction performance for the fishery data of Chinese
                 companies, except for June and July. Additionally,
                 fishing efforts could be used as alternative data for
                 fishery research. The study has also suggested that
                 fishery data are restricted by spatial and temporal
                 distribution and fishing experience, which probably
                 biases the results of the research.",

                 transformation and upgrade of the fishery industry, and
                 optimize the structure of marine aquaculture. Using the
                 panel data of DSCA in China's coastal areas from 2013
                 to 2021, this study constructs the SBM--Malmquist model
                 to measure the DSCA production efficiency and analyzes
                 its total factor productivity. The results show that
                 the overall DSCA production efficiency exhibited an
                 increasing trend in spite of a sharp decline in 2019.
                 The efficiency exhibited regional differences, being
                 the strongest in the Bohai Sea region, followed by in
                 the Yellow Sea, the South China Sea, and the East China
                 Sea regions. The overall total factor productivity
                 remained generally stable, although a large fluctuation
                 occurred between 2019 and 2021. Both pure technological
                 efficiency and scale efficiency promoted the total
                 factor productivity in 2019--2021, while the efficiency
                 of technological changes in societal aspects declined.
                 This study shows that the DSCA production efficiency is
                 significantly influenced by input factors such as labor
                 and capital investment. In addition, natural disasters

                 The mitochondrial genome analysis of eight Pterioidea
                 species indicated the existence of gene rearrangements
                 within the superfamily. The ATP8 gene was not detected

  abstract =     "Fishing contributes significantly to food security and
                 offers employment and income to many coastal
                 communities worldwide. On the other hand, it has been
                 recognized as a dangerous and demanding activity that
                 involves high economic risk and uncertainty as well as
                 outdoor work and interactions with nature, which makes
                 fishing more of a way of life rather than just a way to
                 make a living. Non-monetary attributes of fishing have
                 been reported to affect fishers' decision-making and
                 management and can explain the resilience and
                 sustainability of the sector, even in difficult
                 economic circumstances that hinder profitability. This
                 study uses multivariate statistical analysis to
                 identify profiles of Greek fishers according to their
                 motives and objectives and to link them to the main
                 demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Overall,
                 five fisher profiles are identified, including ``profit
                 maximizers'', ``business-oriented'' and ``subsistence''
                 fishers. Our analysis indicates that all fishers value
                 the non-monetary attributes of the activity higher than
                 monetary values like profit, though large-scale fishers
                 seem to be more business-oriented than small-scale
                 fishers. The identification and understanding of the
                 objective profiles provide useful insights to
                 researchers, advisors and policymakers regarding
                 fishers' decision-making and can ultimately lead to
                 more efficient policy design and fisheries

                 intensifying coldspots (25.07\%). The
                 no-pattern-detected type (10.53\%) is distributed
                 between coldspots and hotspots. The fishing grounds
                 exhibited longitudinal oscillations of {3$^\circ
                 $}--6{$^\circ $} and latitudinal oscillations of
                 {1$^\circ $}--2{$^\circ $}. The spatial autocorrelation
                 of cold and hot spot distribution was strong, and the
                 spatiotemporal dynamic changes in skipjack resources
                 were closely related to the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern
                 Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Notably, during
                 2011--2016, hotspots exhibited an eastward expansion
                 trend, which continued from 2017--2019 due to the
                 influence of fishery management measures, such as the
                 Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) system.",

  abstract =     "Molting is an essential operation in the life of every
                 lobster, and observing this process will help us to
                 assist lobsters in their recovery. However, traditional
                 observation consumes a significant amount of time and
                 labor. This study aims to develop an autonomous
                 AI-based robot monitoring system to detect molt. In
                 this study, we used an optimized Yolov5s algorithm and
                 DeepLabCut tool to analyze and detect all six molting
                 phases such as S1 (normal), S2 (stress), S3--S5 (molt),
                 and S6 (exoskeleton). We constructed the proposed
                 optimized Yolov5s algorithm to analyze the frequency of
                 posture change between S1 (normal) and S2 (stress).
                 During this stage, if the lobster stays stressed for
                 80\% of the past 6 h, the system will assign the
                 keypoint from the DeepLabCut tool to the lobster hip.
                 The process primarily concentrates on the S3--S5 stage
                 to identify the variation in the hatching spot. At the
                 end of this process, the system will re-import the
                 optimized Yolov5s to detect the presence of an
                 independent shell, S6, inside the tank. The optimized
                 Yolov5s embedded a Convolutional Block Attention Module
                 into the backbone network to improve the feature
                 extraction capability of the model, which has been
                 evaluated by evaluation metrics, comparison studies,
                 and IoU comparisons between Yolo's to understand the
                 network's performance. Additionally, we conducted

  abstract =     "The warming and acidification of surface waters as
                 predicted by the IPCC leads aquatic species to face
                 major multifaceted changes in their environment.
                 Although teleosts have efficient regulatory systems to
                 cope with these changes, such changes clearly have the
                 potential to impact their physiological functions.
                 Hence, it is crucial to estimate the ability of teleost
                 fishes to cope with multi-stresses to predict how they
                 will deal with future environments. In this context, we
                 investigated the joint effect of warming and
                 acidification on three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus
                 aculeatus) from the juvenile stage to adulthood,
                 focusing on parameters linked to growth, sexual
                 maturation, and reproduction. Juvenile sticklebacks
                 were split in 2 climate scenarios: a ``Current''
                 scenario corresponding to the current seasonal
                 physico-chemical parameters of the water of the ``Rade
                 de Brest'' in France, and a ``RCP8.5'' scenario with a
                 warming of 3 {$^\circ $}C and an acidification of 0.4
                 pH units. After 7 months, fish in the RCP8.5 scenario
                 reached the same size and mass as those in the Current
                 scenario, but they needed greater amounts of food to
                 reach satiety. Furthermore, the mortality rate over the
                 experiment was higher in the RCP8.5 scenario. Muscle
                 lipid content, an indicator of energy reserves, was
                 lower in females in the RCP8.5 scenario, suggesting an
                 increased need for energy to maintain homeostasis and
                 other physiological functions or a divergence in energy
                 allocation strategy. Moreover, females exhibited lower
                 sexual maturation and egg quality under the RCP8.5
                 scenario, which could have contributed to the lower
                 fertilisation rate observed. Males were more resilient
                 to the RCP8.5 scenario, exhibiting only a trend for
                 lower kidney somatic index scores. Altogether, these
                 results suggest a delay and/or an inhibition of
                 gametogenesis and maturation in fish in warmed and
                 acidified waters. The analysis of blood sex steroid
                 concentrations, brain gene expression profiles, and
                 physiological indexes did not allow us to discriminate
                 between a delay and an inhibition of maturation in the
                 RCP8.5 scenario. Overall, these findings clearly
                 indicate that there is a long-term global impact of
                 combined acidification and warming on the mortality and
                 reproductive performance of three-spined stickleback.",

  abstract =     "During winter, stream fishes are vulnerable to
                 semi-aquatic predators like mammals and birds and
                 reduce encounters by being active in darkness or under
                 surface ice. Less is known about the behavior of fishes
                 towards instream piscivorous fishes. Here, we examined
                 how surface ice and light affected the anti-predator
                 behavior of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta
                 Linnaeus, 1758) in relation to piscivorous burbot (Lota
                 lota Linnaeus, 1758) and northern pike (Esox lucius
                 Linnaeus, 1758) at 4 {$^\circ $}C in experimental
                 flumes. Trout had lower foraging and swimming activity
                 and spent more time sheltering when predators were
                 present than when absent. In daylight, trout's swimming
                 activity was not affected by predators, whereas in
                 darkness trout were less active when predators were
                 present. Trout consumed more drifting prey during the
                 day when ice was present, and they positioned
                 themselves further upstream when under ice cover,
                 regardless of light conditions. Trout stayed closer to
                 conspecifics under ice, but only in the presence of
                 pike. Piscivorous fishes thus constitute an essential
                 part of the predatory landscape of juvenile trout in
                 winter, and thus loss of ice cover caused by climate
                 warming will likely affect trout's interactions with
                 predators.",

                 position (TP) was estimated using {\delta} 15 N
                 baselines (zooplankton) and {\delta} 15 N wahoo values
                 for each region, and mean TP was 0.4 to 0.9 higher in

                 crucial for maintaining migratory fish populations. In
                 this study, we aimed to understand the spatio-temporal
                 distribution of fish eggs in the upper S{\~a}o
                 Francisco River using high sampling frequency and DNA
                 metabarcoding identification. We evaluated the possible
                 effects of the non-molecular identification of eggs and
                 decreased sampling frequency on the determination of
                 spawning sites and major breeding periods. Collections
                 were carried out every three days from November 2019 to
                 February 2020. We found that, if we had assumed that
                 all of the free and non-adhesive sampled eggs belonged
                 to migratory species, as is usual in the literature,
                 this assumption would have been wrong for both the
                 spawning sites and the breeding periods. Moreover, any
                 decrease in the frequency of sampling could
                 dramatically affect the determination of the major
                 spawning rivers, and the spawning events of some of the
                 migratory species may not have been detected.
                 Therefore, without the proper identification and
                 adequate sampling frequency of eggs, important spawning
                 sites may be overlooked, leading to ineffective or
                 inappropriate conservation measures.",

                 in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. Here, we
                 report the presence of freshwater turtles (Cuora
                 amboinensis) from Car Nicobar, a small remote island in
                 the Nicobar archipelago comprising the Andaman and
                 Nicobar Islands. Semi-structured interviews were
                 conducted with the people belonging to Nicobarese
                 tribes (n = 233) to gather their local ecological
                 knowledge as supportive information to obtain a better
                 understanding of the status of turtles in Car Nicobar.
                 Most interviewees (90\%) opined that freshwater turtles
                 are found to be rare or very rare on the Island. All
                 the respondents (100\%) expressed willingness to
                 contribute to future conservation projects.
                 Community-level awareness emerged as a prominent issue
                 for future conservation using the Garrett ranking
                 method. A stream network map was prepared using the
                 digital elevation model to visualize streams and
                 potential habitats of turtles. This report on the
                 freshwater turtles is essential from an ecological
                 perspective since information is scarce on the
                 freshwater turtles in Car Nicobar. This study
                 emphasizes the importance of the engagement of
                 stakeholders in conservation projects and recommends
                 providing adequate attention to the conservation and

                 vessels are important in facilitating effective

  abstract =     "In this study, the compound aquaculture model of red
                 tilapia (O. mossambicus albina $ \times $ O. urolepis
                 hornorum) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) was used
                 to investigate the effect of water spinach rafts on the
                 water quality, antioxidant system, non-specific immune
                 response, and growth performance of red tilapia and the
                 carbon balance of payments. Red tilapia is
                 characterized by its high adaptability to different
                 production environments and food sources, as one of the
                 most productive fish in aquaculture, and is well
                 accepted in the market due to its nutritional and
                 organoleptic characteristics. The experiment lasted for
                 nine weeks and included two systems: the red
                 tilapia-water spinach raft aquaponics (AP) system with
                 10\% cover ratio with water spinach floating beds, and
                 the aquatic monoculture (AM) system with only red
                 tilapia. The total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen
                 (TN), and nitrate nitrogen (NO {$-$} 3 -N) in the AM
                 were higher than those in AP from the fifth to ninth
                 week. On the second, third, fifth, and sixth weeks, the
                 ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 + -N), in the AM was higher than
                 those in the AP. From the seventh week, the pH of the
                 AM was significantly lower than the AP, while the
                 nitrite nitrogen (NO {$-$} 2 -N) was significantly
                 higher than the AP. The water quality index of the AP
                 was better than that of the AM, indicating that water
                 spinach can remove the nutrients from aquaculture water
                 bodies. The average daily gain and specific growth rate
                 (SGR) of fish in AP were higher than those in the AM.
                 The acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP),
                 and catalase (CAT) activities in the hepatopancreas of
                 red tilapia in the AP were also significantly higher
                 than those in the AM, while the malondialdehyde (MDA)
                 in the AP was lower than the AM. The serum ACP and CAT
                 of red tilapia in the AP were also higher than those in
                 the AM, while the MDA of fish in the AP was lower than
                 the AM. The results showed that both the experimental
                 group and the control group were carbon sources and
                 released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but the
                 total carbon emissions of the red tilapia and the water
                 spinach symbiotic system in the experimental group was
                 significantly lower than that of the control group (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). These results demonstrated that the
                 application of water spinach rafts in aquaponics can
                 not only improve the water quality, but also improve
                 the growth performance, antioxidant system and
                 non-specific immune responses of red tilapia, while
                 promoting the utilization of organic matter in the
                 aquaculture system, improving the ecological benefits

                 mitogenome was 16,712 bp long, with biased A + T
                 content (52.33\%), and featured thirteen protein-coding
                 genes (PCGs), twenty-two tRNAs, two rRNAs, and the
                 control region (D-loop). The H strand encoded

                 rRNA) and the control region, whereas the L strand
                 encoded the remaining nine genes (ND6 and eight tRNA).

  abstract =     "The biofloc technology system (BFT) is considered to
                 be one of the sustainable aquaculture systems, which is
                 based on the principle of nutrient recycling with the
                 addition of a carbon source to give dominance to
                 heterotrophic microorganisms. The objective of this
                 study was to evaluate the effect of sugar cane molasses
                 and tapioca flour as carbon sources on the water
                 quality, growth, hematology, immune status, and
                 non-specific antioxidant status of Oreochromis
                 juveniles. Methodologically, the experiment was carried
                 out for 10 weeks on 225 juvenile Nile tilapia with
                 initial body weights of 47.0 {\pm} 1.3 g that were
                 randomly distributed in 09 tanks (1000 L) with a
                 stocking density of 25 tilapias per tank; the
                 treatments were: BFT + SM (S molasses), BFT + TF
                 tapioca flour (TF), and a control with no carbon source
                 added. The control group was fed 100\% feed, while the
                 BFT experimental groups were fed microbial flocs along
                 with 75\% feed. The results revealed that the water
                 quality parameters were affected by the carbon sources,
                 but were adequate for normal fish welfare, and the
                 biofloc volume was higher (28.94) with the TF carbon
                 source. The growth performance, such as weight gain
                 (98.61), survival (99.01), and improved feed conversion
                 ratio (FCR) (1.69), was recorded in BFT + TF.
                 Significant improvements in WBCs, HCT, HB, lymphocytes,
                 plasma proteins, albumin, and non-specific immune
                 factors (lysozyme activity, immunoglobulins levels, and
                 ACH50) were observed in biofloc-reared fish with
                 tapioca flour as the carbon source compared to the
                 control and sugarcane molasses groups. Moreover,
                 significant increases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide
                 dismutase (SOD) were found in the biofloc-reared fish
                 with different carbon sources. In conclusion, the use
                 of BFT + TF was found to affect improving the water
                 quality, growth, hematology, immunity, and antioxidant
                 status of juvenile Tilapia.",

                 in the coastal waters of Hainan Island based on data
                 from fishery stock surveys conducted in the spring and
                 autumn of 2022. The methods of chi-square test,

                 coefficient (AC), cluster analysis, and redundancy
                 analysis were used to analyze the interspecific
                 associations and influence of environmental factors on
                 the ecological niches of fish communities. According to
                 the cluster analysis of niche breadth, 20 main fishes
                 could be divided into broad, medium, and narrow niche
                 species. There were four and eight broad niche species
                 in spring and autumn, respectively. The ranges of niche
                 overlap values were 0.001--0.91 in spring and 0--0.87
                 in autumn, indicating that the species differed and
                 were similar in their ability to utilize resources,
                 survive in habitats, and prey. According to the
                 variance ratio and statistic value W, the main fishes
                 in spring showed a significant positive association,
                 whereas those in autumn showed a positive association,
                 but not at a significant level, indicating that the
                 main fishes in spring were more closely associated with
                 each other. There were 56 species pairs in the 2
                 seasons that were significantly associated ({\chi} 2
                 {\geq} 3.841). AC and PC tests revealed that the
                 interspecific association was strong and tended to be
                 positive. According to the redundancy analysis,
                 environmental factors such as surface temperature,
                 water depth, and pH significantly affected the main
                 fishes in spring, while environmental factors such as
                 dissolved oxygen, bottom temperature, surface salinity,

                 drives loss of genetic diversity. Many studies provide
                 evidence of declines in genetic diversity; however,
                 controversy exists within the literature, as some
                 studies show evidence of no change in genetic diversity
                 despite decades of overharvesting. The apparent
                 discrepancy in the literature should therefore be
                 examined to understand what biological and ecological
                 processes are driving the differences in results. Here,
                 we assess how different factors contribute to
                 fisheries-induced susceptibility to declines in genetic
                 diversity by first focusing on the different roles of
                 genetic markers. Second, we assess how habitat type and
                 conditions contribute to loss of genetic diversity.
                 Third, we assess how life history and physiology
                 affects catchability and loss of genetic diversity.
                 Finally, we discuss how coinciding abiotic and biotic
                 factors influence the intensity of genetic loss. We
                 find a multitude of these factors could be interacting
                 to influence how results are perceived and how intense
                 the loss of genetic diversity can be. Future studies
                 should carefully consider the methodology of genetic
                 analysis used, as well as considerations of life

                 understudied, multi-species fish assemblage in inland
                 Washington (USA) waters. Driven by large-scale fishery
                 removals in the 1970s, their numbers declined and have
                 yet to recover, perhaps due to slow maturation and rare
                 recruitment success. Since then, rockfish fishing
                 restrictions have increased within Puget Sound,
                 culminating in a 2010 total ban. Here, we analyze
                 rockfish community trends (abundance and Shannon
                 Diversity) within Puget Sound from 2009 to 2023. Our
                 dataset includes 157 recorded dive transects from nine
                 rocky or artificial reef habitats at depths 5--24 m
                 throughout four Puget Sound basins: Admiralty Inlet (2
                 sites), Central Puget Sound (4 sites), Hood Canal (2

                 differences in community species composition between
                 basins were observed; we noted more Black (S.
                 melanops), Yellowtail (S. flavidus), and Puget Sound
                 (S. emphaeus) rockfish and fewer Brown rockfish (S.
                 auriculatus) at sites in Admiralty Inlet vs. Central
                 Puget Sound. Adult rockfish counts and Shannon
                 Diversity varied seasonally, with higher rockfish
                 counts and diversity indices in summer/autumn vs.
                 winter/spring. Notably, we observed that total adult
                 rockfish count per survey tended downward over time,
                 driven partly by significant downward trends in Hood
                 Canal Copper rockfish (S. caurinus) counts. We

                 Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and the immune response of
                 Epinephelus coioides. To achieve this, RNA interference
                 (RNAi) was used to silence the luxR gene, and the
                 pathogenicity of wild-type and luxR -RNAi strains of P.
                 plecoglossicida, as well as the immune response of
                 Epinephelus coioides to the infection of these two
                 strains, were compared. The mutant strain with the
                 highest silencing efficiency of 70.1\% was selected for
                 subsequent analysis. Silencing the luxR gene in the
                 mutant strain resulted in a significant 30\% reduction
                 in mortality rates in artificially infected Epinephelus
                 coioides compared to the wild-type strain.
                 Transcriptome analysis revealed that the host
                 transcriptome, particularly in the spleens of infected
                 Epinephelus coioides, was markedly altered by the
                 silencing of the luxR gene in the mutant strain.
                 Tilapia infected with the luxR -RNAi strain exhibited
                 altered immune defenses, with changes in gene
                 expression primarily in the NOD-like receptor (NLR)
                 signaling pathway. These results suggest that the luxR
                 gene plays a crucial role in the host's resistance to
                 pathogen invasion, and reducing its expression could
                 decrease quorum sensing (QS) signals while increasing
                 the expression of the IL-1{\beta} gene in the host's
                 NLR pathway. This effect may lead to a pro-inflammatory
                 response that enhances the immune response to
                 infection. Further investigation of these mechanisms
                 may lead to innovative approaches to treating bacterial
                 infections.",

  abstract =     "Pheromones play a vital role in regulating fish
                 behavior, including reproduction, aggregation, hazard
                 recognition and food location. To gain a better
                 understanding of chemical communication in fish
                 produced by density changes, this study analyzed the
                 metabolites released by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus)
                 under different stocking densities. The experiment was
                 conducted at low (LD: 3.01 kg/m 2), medium (MD: 6.62
                 kg/m 2) and high (HD: 10.84 kg/m 2) densities for 15
                 days. High-throughput non-targeted metabolomics
                 (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify variations in
                 metabolites released into the aquatic environment by
                 turbot at different densities. Results showed that 29
                 and 47 metabolites were significantly upregulated in
                 the MD and HD groups, respectively, compared with the
                 LD group. Among them, hexadecanedioic acid, xanthine,
                 phenethylamine, proline and styrene were significantly
                 upregulated in the MD vs. LD, HD vs. MD and HD vs. LD.
                 The VIP diagram of OPLS-DA alignment showed that
                 phenethylamine was the most important metabolite shared
                 by MD vs. LD, HD vs. MD and HD vs. LD. Key gene changes
                 in the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway, HPI axis of turbot
                 were studied using qRT-PCR for density treatment. The
                 results demonstrated that the expression of GH, GHR and
                 IGF-1 was significantly lower, while the expression of
                 CRH and ACTH was higher in the HD group. Additionally,
                 plasma levels of cortisol, glucose, triglycerides and T
                 3 were also highest in the HD group compared with the
                 LD and MD groups. Phenylethylamine concentration was
                 positively correlated with the HPI axis and negatively
                 correlated with the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway. To
                 investigate the impact of phenethylamine accumulation
                 on turbot, an acute treatment experiment with
                 phenethylamine was set up. Its concentration in the
                 aquatic environment was set at 0 (CON), 10 {$-$7} (LP)
                 and 10 {$-$5} (HP) mol/L via exogenous addition, and
                 turbot were exposed to these environments for 2 days.
                 There was a high degree of concordance between the
                 GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway (GH, GHR, IGF-1), HPI axis
                 (CRH, ACTH) and plasma physiological changes (cortisol,
                 glucose, triglycerides, T 3) in the
                 phenethylamine-treated group and the density-treated
                 group. Therefore, accumulation of phenethylamine with
                 increasing stocking density may be a potential cause of
                 density stress. Phenylethylamine has a dose-dependent
                 and trace effect as a pheromone.",

  abstract =     "Fish play a major role in the human nutritional
                 system, and farmers need to know the accurate
                 prediction of fish weight in order to optimize the
                 production process and reduce costs. However, existing
                 prediction methods are not efficient. The formulas for
                 calculating fish weight are generally designed for a
                 single species of fish or for species of a similar
                 shape. In this paper, a new hybrid method called
                 SFI-XGBoost is proposed. It combines the VIF (variance
                 inflation factor), PCC (Pearson's correlation
                 coefficient), and XGBoost methods, and it covers
                 different fish species. By applying GridSearchCV
                 validation, normalization, augmentation, and encoding
                 techniques, the obtained results show that SFI-XGBoost
                 is more efficient than simple XGBoost. The model
                 generated by our approach is more generalized,
                 achieving accurate results with a wide variety of
                 species. Using the r2_score evaluation metric,
                 SFI-XGBoost achieves an accuracy rate of 99.94\%.",

                 five sampling sections were set up in the lower Yellow
                 River from 2019 to 2022 to investigate the diversity of
                 fishery resources. A total of 54 fish species were
                 identified in the survey, belonging to 9 orders, 19
                 families, and 48 genera. The number of species reached
                 its highest level since the Integrated Water Regulation
                 of the Lower Yellow River in 1999. The original rare
                 and endangered fish species in the lower reaches of the
                 Yellow River, such as Coilia nasus, Rhinogobio nasutus,
                 and Pseudobagrus ussuriensis, have reappeared in the
                 lower reaches. The population and abundance of main
                 economic fish and common small-sized fish in the lower
                 reaches of the Yellow River have increased. These signs
                 all indicate that, and the fishery resources are
                 recovering slowly in the lower Yellow River. By
                 comparing the fish resources of various investigation
                 sections, it was found that there are differences in
                 fish diversity: the closer to the estuarine waters, the
                 higher the variety of fish in the Yellow River at the
                 upper level of the taxonomic category. However, that
                 section of the lower Yellow River where species
                 evenness, species diversity, and community structure of
                 fishery resources were most stable was the confluence
                 of Dongping Lake into the Yellow River, which has the
                 most significant number of fish species, the smallest
                 {\Lambda} + value, and the most extensive G-F index.
                 The above results indicate that Dongping Lake, as the
                 only lake connected to the lower reaches of the Yellow

  abstract =     "In recent years, with the development of pelagic
                 fishing, the working environment and monitoring of crew
                 (squid jigger) members have become increasingly
                 important. However, traditional methods of pelagic
                 human observers suffer from high costs, low coverage,
                 poor timeliness, and susceptibility to subjective
                 factors. In contrast, the Electronic Monitoring System
                 (EMS) has advantages such as continuous operation under
                 various weather conditions; more objective,
                 transparent, and efficient data; and less interference
                 with fishing operations. This paper shows how the 3DCNN
                 model, LSTM+ResNet model, and TimeSformer model are
                 applied to video-classification tasks, and for the
                 first time, they are applied to an EMS. In addition,
                 this paper tests and compares the application effects
                 of the three models on video classification, and
                 discusses the advantages and challenges of using them
                 for video recognition. Through experiments, we obtained
                 the accuracy and relevant indicators of video
                 recognition using different models. The research
                 results show that when NUM_FRAMES is set to 8, the
                 LSTM+ResNet-50 model has the best performance, with an
                 accuracy of 88.47\%, an F1 score of 0.8881, and an map
                 score of 0.8133. Analyzing the EMS for pelagic fishing
                 can improve China's performance level and management
                 efficiency in pelagic fishing, and promote the
                 development of the fishery knowledge service system and

                 showed that the extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGbs)
                 inhibited the lipid oxidation in material above. Of all
                 of EGbs, EAE showed the strongest T-AOC, MCA and
                 protective effects against the lipid oxidation. Next,
                 fish feeds were incubated with graded levels of EAE.
                 The results showed that EAE inhibited lipid oxidation
                 in fish feeds. The optimal inclusion levels of EAE for
                 minimizing lipid oxidation were 4.26 g kg {$-$1} feeds.
                 The effect of EGbs on the lipid oxidation may be
                 closely associated with their flavonoid content.
                 Finally, juvenile carp (14.8 {\pm} 0.4 g) were fed with
                 EAE at concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 6.0 g kg
                 {$-$1} for 60 days. Current data displayed that dietary
                 EAE increased the growth performance of fish. This
                 result of EAE may be ascribed to its enhancing effect
                 on the activity of digestive and absorptive enzymes and
                 antioxidant capacity in digestive organs of fish.
                 Furthermore, dietary EAE decreased the
                 hot-drying-induced lipid oxidation in fish meat through
                 inhibiting the induction effect of hemoglobin in
                 erythrocytes. Our study suggests that EGb can be
                 considered as a potential natural antioxidant for fish

                 to ineffective enforcement of regulations and declining
                 exports. Employing a mixed-methods approach and
                 blending qualitative and quantitative data, we assessed
                 the impact of military intervention on Lake Victoria's
                 Nile perch fishery, focusing on fishing effort, catch,
                 and exports. Our findings indicate that military
                 operations adhered to regulations, gaining primary
                 support from key stakeholders, specifically motorized
                 fishing operators. Consequently, between 2016 and 2020,
                 legal fishing activities experienced substantial
                 growth. By 2021, approximately 90\% of Nile perch
                 catches were made by motorized vessels using longlines
                 and gillnets, despite a declining trend in
                 catch-per-unit effort. Between 2015 and 2021, the Nile
                 perch fishery saw changes: boat seines made up about
                 5\% of motorized fleet catches in 2021, while catches
                 in paddled vessels increased from 20\% to over 50\%,
                 suggesting a potential role in the growing longline
                 fishery. Therefore, the current management approach
                 does not increase catches or exports compared with the
                 co-management period. The observed decline in
                 catch-per-unit effort among motorized gillnets suggests
                 overcapacity. Further research is needed to comprehend
                 the broader sociological and ecological impacts of the
                 present enforcement strategy for sustainable fishery
                 management.",

                 nigrensis) to assess how life-long experience with
                 different male mating tactics shapes coercion evasion
                 ability and female spatial cognition. We raised females
                 from birth to adulthood in environments that varied by
                 male mating tactic: coercers only, courtship displayers
                 only, coercers and displayers together,
                 mixed-strategists, and female only. In adulthood, we
                 tested females' behavioral responses to a coercive male
                 and spatial cognition in a maze. Females reared with
                 only displayers were significantly worse at distancing
                 themselves from the coercive male than females raised
                 with coercers and displayers and females raised with
                 only coercers. Females raised with a single mating
                 tactic (either courtship display or coercion) exhibited
                 significantly higher accuracy in the spatial maze than
                 females from other rearing groups, and showed
                 significant reduction in total errors (courtship
                 display group) or latency to reward (coercion group)
                 over successive trials. These more predictable
                 environments (one tactic), and not the more complex
                 environments (two tactics), showed evidence for spatial
                 learning. The results are discussed in light of the
                 existing literature on two components of environmental
                 change (environmental predictability and the certainty
                 with which cues predict the best behavioral response)

                 total length (TL) across various mesh sizes. A marine
                 fishing experiment was conducted at Gajin Harbor in
                 Goseong County, Gangwon Province, employing
                 experimental gear with four different mesh sizes: 90,
                 105, 135, and 150 mm. Mesh selectivity analysis
                 involved a comparative assessment of selectivity curve
                 methods through normal, log-normal, and bi-normal
                 functions. Among these, the bi-normal function
                 demonstrated the best fit for estimating the mesh
                 selectivity curve within the SELECT model. The critical
                 finding was the net size at which 50\% of the minimum

                 different ecological habitats to analyze the habitat
                 changes in economically important fish in the Beibu
                 Gulf. The maximum entropy model was constructed based
                 on the data from 26 voyages obtained through the otter
                 trawl fishery stock surveys conducted in the Beibu Gulf
                 from 2006 to 2018. A total of 10 taxa of major fish
                 catches, belonging to 4 families, 1 genus, and 5
                 species, were analyzed for their distribution
                 characteristics in potential habitats during various
                 ecological periods, specifically the withered and
                 high-water periods, as well as their relationships with
                 crucial environmental factors. During both the withered
                 and high-water periods, the average area under the
                 curve was 0.927, and all models had values exceeding
                 0.9. Salinity was identified as the principal factor
                 during both periods. The salinity niche of Acropoma
                 japonicum and the primary productivity niche of
                 Sciaenidae were identified as the most restricted
                 factors. The total distribution area of potentially
                 suitable regions for major fish catches extended
                 between {106$^\circ $}30{\prime}--109{$^\circ

                 $}45{\prime} N, and the area was lesser during the
                 withered period. During the withered period, the
                 distribution areas of Sciaenidae, Leiognathidae, and
                 Saurida increased, while the distribution area of
                 Trachurus japonicus increased during the high-water
                 period. Sciaenidae and Trachurus japonicus exhibited
                 the highest rates of change at 6.22\% and 10.92\%,
                 respectively. This indicates that the high-water period
                 may expand the range of suitable habitats for large
                 catches that have an ideal habitat status in the Beibu
                 Gulf. Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate the
                 potential fish habitats in the Beibu Gulf and clarify

  abstract =     "Over the past few years, China has become a hotspot
                 for the domestication of the commercially valuable
                 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Although the
                 food preference of this fish has been studied, little
                 is known about the genes regulating its growth.
                 Population breeding was performed using two indigenous
                 strains (QT1 and QT2), with the results showing that
                 the organ/body ratio, abdominal fat rate and the body
                 weight gain of QT1 and QT2 were higher than for the
                 offspring YL1 and Y3 which are extensively cultured in
                 China. Subsequent RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allowed for
                 the identification of potential genes and pathways
                 involved in growth performance. Overall, the
                 transcriptome analysis generated 89,056 transcripts and
                 42,529 Unigenes. A PCA revealed significant differences
                 between QT1 and the other three strains, while the
                 other three strains did not show much difference. A
                 KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
                 genes showed that steroid biosynthesis was the most
                 enriched pathway among the four strains. These pathways
                 could be related to the growth of largemouth bass. In
                 addition, a co-expression network analysis suggested a
                 strong interaction between liver steroid biosynthesis
                 and the genes for photosynthesis, secondary metabolism
                 and stress response. Taken together, the above results
                 can provide new insights into the liver metabolism of
                 different strains of largemouth bass during culture and
                 provide references for the subsequent domestication and
                 breeding programs of largemouth bass.",

                 degree of exposure of fish to anthropogenic chemicals
                 in their stream habitats. We hypothesized that brook
                 stickleback (Culaea inconstans) in a headwater stream
                 receiving urban and agricultural runoff (South Fork
                 Whitewater River, SFWR) would exhibit poorer condition,
                 reduced reproductive fitness, and a greater left side
                 to right side morphological asymmetry (i.e.,
                 fluctuating asymmetry or FA) than fish from a nearby
                 headwater stream with a forested drainage basin (Garvin
                 Brook). Male and female fish were collected from both
                 streams just prior to spawning in 2013--2015. In 2013
                 and 2014, fish were assessed for overall condition
                 (Fulton's K), internal measures of condition
                 (hepatosomatic index, HSI) and reproductive fitness
                 (gonadosomatic index [GSI], total oocyte count, and
                 oocyte mass). In 2015, measurements of head length, jaw
                 length, eye diameter, pectoral fin length, and pelvic
                 fin length were made on both sides of each fish for
                 assessing degree of FA. We observed declining condition
                 with fish size, increased liver size, and reduced
                 oocyte counts and oocyte size in female brook
                 stickleback in SFWR relative to those from Garvin
                 Brook. SFWR females had significantly higher FA than
                 Garvin females for all structures assessed, except
                 pelvic fin length. FA also was slightly higher for all
                 structures in SFWR males compared to Garvin males, but
                 differences were not significant. A composite FA index
                 combining all measurements from an individual fish into
                 a single value displayed highly significant differences
                 for female fish (SFWR FA {$ > $$ >$ } Garvin FA), but
                 not for male fish (SFWR FA = Garvin FA). Exposure of
                 brook stickleback to reduced water quality in SFWR
                 during early development appears to increase
                 morphological asymmetry in female (but not male) fish,
                 and continuing exposure to compromised water quality

                 identify and classify, from the available literature,
                 non-conventional feed ingredients from terrestrial
                 plants, animals, algae, and fungi which have been
                 evaluated for their potential use for tilapia
                 (Oreochromis spp.) production. For this purpose, 795
                 papers published in the Scopus and Web of Science
                 databases between 2011 and 2021 were analyzed using the
                 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
                 Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Data on the growth
                 rate (GR) and effects on weight gain (WG), specific
                 growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR);
                 digestibility; fatty acid profile (FAP) of the fish
                 carcass; and the survival rate (SR) were compiled in
                 databases and summary tables. The results were refined
                 according to different criteria, obtaining 144
                 documents that were pertinent for an in-depth analysis.
                 From those, we found that 50.7\% evaluated terrestrial
                 plants, 22.2\% animals, 13.9\% algae, 9\% fungi, and
                 the remaining, combinations of some of the above
                 categories. From the summarized results we concluded
                 that most of the non-conventional sources analyzed have
                 a positive potential impact as alternatives for
                 producing tilapia. Survival was the most evaluated

  abstract =     "Stocking density is a key factor affecting the health
                 of aquatic organisms in industrial aquaponics. In this
                 study, Micropterus salmoides were assigned to one of
                 two density groups (160 and 120 fish/m 3) for 40 days.
                 The growth performance, intestinal morphology, enzyme
                 activity, and microbial communities were compared
                 between the two density groups. The findings revealed
                 that the higher stocking density condition exhibited an
                 increased weight gain rate and specific growth rate
                 during the developmental phase of the juvenile M.
                 salmoides. Moreover, remarkable increases in villi
                 height, villi width, and muscular layer thickness were
                 observed. Additionally, this elevated stocking density
                 condition also enhanced the activity of intestinal
                 antioxidant enzymes, consequently improving the
                 structural integrity of the intestine and augmenting
                 the digestive and absorptive capacities of the juvenile
                 M. salmoides. With regard to the intestinal microbial
                 community, the dominant phyla detected were Firmicutes
                 and Proteobacteria. However, under the higher stocking
                 density condition, there was a significant upsurge in
                 the abundance of Mycoplasma. Consequently, it is
                 advised to mitigate the abundance of such pathogenic
                 microorganisms through the regulation of the water
                 environment during the aquacultural process. Drawing
                 from recent investigations on the impact of various
                 factors on the intestinal microbiota of M. salmoides,
                 it can be deduced that the composition of the
                 intestinal microbiota is closely intertwined with
                 factors including aquaculture practices, feed
                 composition, water environment, and developmental
                 stage. In summary, the aforementioned research findings
                 possess noteworthy implications for the control of

                 remains an obstacle for formulated feed development.
                 This study examined the relationship between feeding
                 efficiency and feed waste by juvenile spiny lobster,
                 Sagmariasus verreauxi, fed different formulated pellet
                 diameters or lengths across two separate experiments.
                 Feed texture (hard and dry pellet, HDP; soft and moist
                 pellet, SMP) was also examined. Juvenile lobsters were
                 fed experimental feeds at 0.5\% BW daily over a 6 h
                 duration. The resulting feed waste was categorised as
                 either feeding-related waste (FRW) or
                 non-feeding-related waste (NFRW). For all feed types,
                 the FRW increased with increasing pellet diameter and
                 pellet length. The increase in FRW corresponded with a
                 decrease in NFRW, particularly for HDP, resulting in no
                 difference in total feed waste in any treatment
                 investigated. Thus, even with improved feeding
                 efficiency with small feed dimensions, feed intake was
                 not improved. Feed leaching rate decreased with
                 increasing pellet size, suggesting a more rapid decline
                 in feed attractiveness for smaller pellets. This
                 finding indicates that currently a counteractive
                 interaction exists between pellet size and feed
                 attractiveness and suggests improving attractiveness
                 would further enhance feeding. Future research should
                 aim at optimising feed dimensions simultaneously to
                 support efficient feeding whilst enhancing
                 attraction/gustatory stimulations.",

                 a thirty-year, open-source, continental-scale
                 ecological observation platform. The objective of the
                 NEON project is to provide data to facilitate the
                 understanding and forecasting of the ecological impacts
                 of anthropogenic change at a continental scale. Fish
                 are sentinel taxa in freshwater systems, and the NEON
                 has been sampling and collecting fish assemblage data
                 at wadable stream sites for six years. One to two NEON
                 wadable stream sites are located in sixteen domains
                 from Alaska to Puerto Rico. The goal of site selection
                 was that sites represent local conditions but with the
                 intention that site data be analyzed at a continental
                 observatory level. Site selection did not include fish
                 assemblage criteria. Without using fish assemblage
                 criteria, anomalies in fish assemblages at the site
                 level may skew the expected spatial patterns of North
                 American stream fish assemblages, thereby hindering
                 change detection in subsequent years. However, if NEON
                 stream sites are representative of the current spatial
                 distributions of North American stream fish
                 assemblages, we could expect to find the most diverse
                 sites in Atlantic drainages and the most depauperate
                 sites in Pacific drainages. Therefore, we calculated
                 the alpha and regional (beta) diversities of wadable
                 stream sites to highlight spatial patterns. As
                 expected, NEON sites followed predictable spatial
                 diversity patterns, which could facilitate future
                 change detection and attribution to changes in

                 reproductive strategies in seahorses. However, the
                 detailed process of gonadal development in seahorses,
                 particularly in the pot-bellied seahorse (Hippocampus

                 process of the pot-bellied seahorse under captive
                 breeding conditions (18 {\pm} 1 {$^\circ $}C).
                 Immediately after birth, primordial germ cells (PGCs)
                 were found within the genital ridge, enclosed by a
                 single layer of somatic cells. Around 7--9 days after
                 birth (DAB), the ovary begins to differentiate. By 30
                 DAB, two germinal ridges had formed along the edge of
                 the follicular lamina in the ovary. The primary
                 oocytes, resulting from this differentiation process,
                 gradually migrated from the dorsal sides to the
                 mid-ventral area of the ovary, eventually maturing into
                 eggs. In the testis, the primary and secondary
                 spermatocytes appeared at 15 and 30 DAB, respectively,
                 preceding the formation of the testicular lumen (50
                 DAB). The testis was observed to consist of a single
                 large germinal compartment. Under captive breeding
                 conditions in Northern China, the pot-bellied seahorse
                 demonstrated year-round breeding capability, with each
                 male producing approximately 100--150 larvae. The

  abstract =     "Fishes are ecologically important organisms that have
                 long lifespans, high mobilities, and diverse trophic
                 levels. Due to their importance, fishes are used as
                 bioindicators for monitoring aquatic environments. One
                 method for monitoring fishes is based on environmental
                 DNA (eDNA), which are the deoxynucleic acids released
                 by organisms into the environment. However, there has
                 been a problem with false positives because eDNA is
                 relatively stable in the environment and could even
                 likely represent dead or non-inhabiting organisms. To
                 address this weakness, environmental RNA (eRNA), which
                 degrades more rapidly than eDNA in the environment, can
                 be utilized to complement eDNA. But, to date, few
                 studies have used eRNA for freshwater fish monitoring.
                 In this study, to determine the relative usefulness of
                 eDNA and eRNA metabarcoding in freshwater fishes, we
                 performed eDNA and eRNA metabarcoding on 12S rRNA
                 targeting fish using water samples that were collected
                 from three locations in the Han River. We then
                 calculated the sensitivity and positive predictivity of
                 this approach by comparing our data to the previous
                 specimen capture survey (PSCS) data from the last six
                 years. The results showed that 42 species were detected
                 by eDNA and 19 by eRNA at the three locations. At all
                 locations, compared to the PSCS data, the average
                 sensitivity was higher for eDNA (46.1\%) than for eRNA
                 (34.6\%), and the average positive predictivity was
                 higher for eRNA (31.7\%) than for eDNA (20.7\%). This
                 confirmed that eDNA metabarcoding has the advantage of
                 broadly determining species presence or absence
                 (including those that are no longer present or dead),
                 but it also generates false positives; meanwhile, eRNA
                 metabarcoding reports living fish species, but detects
                 fewer species than eDNA. Combining eDNA and eRNA
                 therefore emphasizes their advantages and compensates
                 for their disadvantages, and conducting this may
                 therefore be useful for identifying false positives and
                 monitoring the fish species that are actually present
                 in the environment. This metabarcoding technique can be
                 used in the future to provide insights into the aquatic
                 environment and the monitoring of fisheries.",

                 shellfish found in the Yellow and Bohai Seas areas of
                 China. In this study, samples of Neptunea cumingii were
                 collected in Zhangzidao and Yantai during spring,
                 summer, autumn, and winter to clarify the gene
                 expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms in their
                 gills in different seasons. Transcriptome analysis was
                 conducted using Neptunea cumingii gill tissues, and
                 genes with significantly different expression levels
                 were extracted for functional verification. The most
                 genes with differences in expression (DEGs) were found
                 in comparisons of the winter and summer samples. Gene
                 enrichment analysis based on Gene Ontology and Kyoto
                 Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes terms showed that
                 these DEGs were mainly involved in immune and metabolic
                 pathways, and they had significant effects on oxidative
                 stress, body metabolism, and protein synthesis in
                 Neptunea cumingii. Further screening of DEGs identified
                 thirty-four genes related to temperature regulation,
                 comprising thirteen genes with roles in innate immunity
                 in shellfish, twelve genes related to oxidative stress,
                 and nine genes related to protein synthesis and energy
                 metabolism. Eleven DEGs were randomly selected for qPCR
                 verification, and the results were consistent with the
                 transcriptome analysis results. In summary, the
                 transcriptome results differed significantly between
                 seasons in the gill tissues of Neptunea cumingii. The
                 expression levels of immune regulatory genes could be
                 promoted in Neptunea cumingii during the high
                 temperature season, whereas the expression of these
                 genes may be inhibited in the low temperature season.
                 The results obtained in this study provide insights
                 into the molecular defense mechanisms that might allow
                 Neptunea cumingii to adapt to climate change.",

  abstract =     "H.G. Moser was not particularly well known regarding
                 the Elopomorpha, but he began his seminal 1981 fish
                 larvae morphology review by describing the mysteries of
                 European eels and their leptocephali, and he eventually
                 described some California Current leptocephali.
                 Descriptions of all types of leptocephali and then
                 microscope photographs have revealed complex
                 pigmentation patterns and diverse body shapes that
                 parallel the features of the other teleost fish larvae
                 that his review showed so clearly, some of which appear
                 to mimic gelatinous zooplankton (GZ). Most recently,
                 underwater photographs and video of leptocephali
                 indicate that predator avoidance through transparency,
                 shape-change-mediated mimicry, or morphological
                 features have evolved in response to natural selection
                 from predation in ways generally similar to other fish
                 larvae. Several families of leptocephali perform
                 remarkable curling into round or flattened shapes or
                 use expandable chromatophores when threatened, which
                 appears to mimic GZ for predation reduction. Like a
                 number of other teleost fish larvae, some leptocephali
                 have body extensions or telescopic eyes, and at least
                 one has a long caudal filament with pigmented swellings
                 that is similar to the remarkable GZ mimicry appendages
                 of some fish larvae. The morphology and use of mimicry
                 of leptocephali in comparison to other fish larvae is
                 reviewed as a tribute to H.G. Moser's remarkable
                 career.",

                 database maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey to

                 sources cited in reviewed documents and provided by
                 numerous reviewers were also included. There were three
                 focus areas designed to provide support for invasive

                 physiological constraints, toxicity, and biology; and

                 providing habitats for numerous aquatic species and
                 crucial ecological services. The Tejo estuary, one of
                 the largest European estuaries, has been thoroughly
                 studied, and its important functional role as a nursery
                 for several commercially important fish species is
                 already established. In the present work, a trait-based
                 approach was applied to functionally describe the fish
                 community structure of the Tejo estuary and to
                 enlighten potential changes in the ecosystem
                 functioning at this level, following environmental
                 changes expected to occur. To predict the distribution
                 of species from the two most representative ecological
                 guilds of the Tejo estuary, estuarine residents and
                 marine migrants, species distribution models were built
                 using an ensemble technique (combining forecasts of
                 single models). The predictions obtained were more
                 accurate for the marine migrants and the species
                 distribution was strongly related with salinity,
                 whereas estuarine species, were also influenced by
                 depth, habitat type and river flow. The potential
                 distributions of these ecological guilds showed that
                 marine migrants will tend to use upstream areas in the
                 estuary, where salinity is lower. Nonetheless, salinity
                 is expected to increase as extreme weather events such
                 as droughts tend to occur more frequently, decreasing
                 favorable habitat availability for these species, and
                 thus threatening the crucial role this ecosystem plays
                 for these species.",

                 of artificial selection on the genetic structure of
                 four whiteleg shrimp strains were evaluated using
                 microsatellite sequences. The results showed that the
                 observed heterozygosity (H o), expected heterozygosity
                 (H e), and the polymorphism information content (PIC)
                 of the four selected strains ranged from 0.446 to
                 0.574, 0.450 to 0.566, and 0.435 to 0.509,
                 respectively. All the selected strains maintained a
                 moderate level of genetic diversity. Most inbreeding
                 coefficients (F is) in the four strains were positive
                 but not significantly different from zero, indicating a
                 relatively low degree of inbreeding within each strain.
                 However, H e and PIC in line 5 showed a decreasing
                 trend from the 2017 to the 2019 generations, and F is
                 in line 10 showed a significant increasing trend across
                 generations, indicating that measures must be taken to
                 maintain the level of genetic diversity for lines 5 and
                 10. UPGMA cluster trees showed that the four breeding
                 lines had apparent genetic differences, which could
                 provide a genetic basis for studying crossbreeding
                 between selective lines and the utilization of
                 heterosis. This study will be useful for population
                 genetic research and the breeding strategies of
                 whiteleg shrimp.",

                 impacts on the aquatic environment, leading to
                 pollution and disease outbreaks in farmed organisms.
                 Biofloc technology (BFT) is a closed aquaculture system
                 that utilizes specific microbial communities to remove
                 ammonia emitted from aquaculture organisms or adds
                 carbon to the aquaculture system to improve water
                 quality. BFT has benefits, such as increasing
                 production and improving water quality, and reducing
                 disease spread and pollution, without the need for
                 water exchange. However, there are disadvantages, such
                 as rapid changes in water quality due to accumulation
                 of dissolved nutrients and total suspended soils (TSS)
                 and the requirement for expensive aeration equipment to
                 maintain dissolved oxygen. BFT can be enhanced in value
                 and efficiency by combining it with other aquaculture
                 technologies, such as aquaponics and vertical
                 aquaculture to overcome the disadvantages. The
                 integration of biofloc with technologies from the
                 fourth industrial revolution holds potential for
                 further development, while aquaponics and vertical
                 farming can eliminate geographical limitations and
                 accelerate the urbanization of aquaculture. The
                 integration of aquaponics and vertical aquaculture with
                 BFT has potential for development, accelerating the

                 recently shown to be a sustainable ingredient for use
                 in diets of several fish species. Additionally, because
                 of its possible immunomodulatory activity and
                 anti-microbial properties, frass may have great
                 potential as an organic method of pathogen control in
                 aquaculture. Five diets containing 0, 5, 10, 20 and
                 30\% frass from black soldier fly larvae, Hermetia
                 illucens, were fed to channel catfish (5.24 {\pm} 0.04
                 g) in quadruplicate aquaria to apparent satiation twice
                 daily. At the end of the 10-week feeding trial, blood
                 samples were collected from all groups to measure
                 hematological and immune parameters, and to determine
                 the effects of dietary frass on resistance to
                 Flavobacterium covae infection. Hematological
                 parameters (red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and
                 hematocrit)---but not white blood cell count---were
                 improved with the inclusion of frass. Serum glucose
                 levels were significantly lower in fish on the diet
                 with frass than fish on the diet without frass. Fish
                 fed the highest dietary levels of frass (30\%) had a
                 significantly higher serum cholesterol level than fish
                 on the control diet. Serum complement activity was
                 significantly higher in fish on diets containing frass
                 at levels of 10\% and 20\%. No significant differences
                 were observed in other measure serum components
                 including albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine
                 aminotransferase, amylase, calcium, phosphorus,
                 potassium, total protein, globulin, thyroxine and
                 lysozyme activity. Even though overall mortality was
                 low (0--17\%), fish on the diets containing frass at
                 levels 20\% or more showed significantly higher
                 survival than that of control fish or fish on lower

                 organisms, including largemouth bass (LMB) and
                 Micropterus salmoides. This study aimed to elucidate
                 the role of bZIP transcription factors in mediating the
                 molecular responses to nitrite stress in the LMB
                 spleen. We identified 120 bZIP genes in the LMB genome
                 using bioinformatics analysis and divided them into 11
                 subgroups based on phylogenetic relationships. Under
                 nitrite stress, the bZIP_XI subgroup was upregulated,
                 suggesting the activation of the stress response in the
                 LMB spleen. Cellular pathway analysis revealed
                 enrichment of pathways related to stress response, DNA
                 repair, apoptosis, and autophagy. Co-expression network
                 analysis highlighted bZIP_XI members such as
                 msabZIP_49, msabZIP_12, msabZIP_39, and msabZIP_116 as
                 potential key regulators. These transcription factors
                 likely modulated the expression of stress-related genes
                 like VCAM1, POLE3, and BMP1. Conserved binding motifs
                 in the promoters of these genes may support regulation
                 by bZIP_XI. Furthermore, bZIP_XI members correlated
                 with immune cell infiltration in the spleen,
                 potentially regulating immune-related genes like BCL2L1
                 and SELE. Homologs of bZIP_XI in other fish species
                 exhibited similar expression patterns under stress.
                 Overall, this study implicates the bZIP transcription
                 factor family, notably the bZIP_XI subgroup, in
                 orchestrating the molecular response of the LMB spleen
                 to nitrite toxicity by regulating stress response
                 pathways and immune function. These findings provide

                 the present study aimed to describe the dietary habits
                 of hardhead catfish and gafftopsail catfish using
                 analysis of stomach contents aided by DNA barcoding.
                 Hardhead (n = 693) and gafftopsail (n = 655) catfish
                 were sampled in the northern GOM from 2015--2019 using
                 both fisheries-dependent and -independent techniques.
                 The average percent number (\%N), average percent mass
                 (\%M), prey specific number (\%PN), prey specific mass
                 (\%PM), and prey-specific index of relative importance
                 (\%PSIRI) were computed to quantify prey species. The

                 differences in diet between hardhead and gafftopsail
                 catfish. Crustaceans were the most important prey for
                 hardhead catfish, while gafftopsail catfish showed a
                 significantly broader dietary breadth and were
                 primarily piscivorous. Multivariate analyses indicated
                 that the location of capture explained the greatest
                 amount of diet variability for both species. These

  abstract =     "We assessed the distribution of alien fishes in the
                 Karun River Basin, Iran. Fish were collected from 39
                 sites during the November--December 2018 low-flow
                 period. In total, 39 fish species from nine orders and
                 14 families were documented. Among these, 10 species
                 were alien to the basin (986 individuals; 15.7\%). Four
                 species were the most abundant alien species and
                 primarily in impounded, downstream reaches. Redundancy
                 analysis (RDA) was conducted to identify the extent of
                 changes in alien fish assemblages with environmental
                 parameters. RDA1 and RDA2 accounted for 36.24\% and
                 25.33\% of the variation of alien species,
                 respectively. Altitude, depth, electrical conductivity,
                 water temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and
                 river width were the most significant parameters
                 affecting alien species distributions. We present a
                 dual-pathway cause-and-effect hypothesis proposing that
                 alien fish species presence causes declines in the
                 ecological status of native fish communities. We then
                 explore how human-induced aquatic ecosystem degradation
                 creates opportunities for alien species to invade new
                 ecosystems, further impacting native fish communities.
                 Our study contributes insight into the cause and effect
                 of the presence of alien fish species in the Karun
                 River Basin and emphasizes the urgency of conservation
                 measures to protect this critically endangered
                 watershed.",

                 and play an important role in food safety. And
                 aquaculture is prized for its high productivity,
                 sustainability and environmental friendliness.
                 Considering the importance of aquaculture, the legal
                 risks exposed during the aquaculture process deserve
                 attention in order to prevent them from hindering the
                 development of the aquaculture industry. Through online
                 research, literature analysis and practical
                 communication, it is shown that the current legal risks
                 with commonalities include land use violations, lack of
                 legal documents, failure to meet tailing water
                 criteria, unquarantined fry and misuse of prohibited
                 agricultural pharmaceuticals through online research,
                 literature analysis and practical communication. By
                 analyzing the reasons for the formation of legal risks
                 and combining the experiences in sustainable
                 development of three major aquaculture countries, which
                 are Korea, Norway and Chile, this paper provides
                 targeted preventive remedies and suggestions for
                 aquaculture operators, administrative parties,
                 legislators and other parties on legal risks. It
                 includes promoting the improvement of the rule of law
                 in multiple aspects, clarifying the positioning of the
                 aquatic breeding certificates, improving and
                 propagating the standards for wastewater discharge,
                 increasing the self-sufficiency rate of aquatic fry and

  abstract =     "Over recent decades, substantial research has focused
                 on fish cognitive evolution to increase our
                 understanding of the evolution of the enormous
                 diversity of cognitive abilities that exists in fishes.
                 One important but understudied aspect of cognitive
                 evolution is sexual dimorphism in cognitive abilities.
                 Sex-specific variation in brain region morphology has
                 been proposed to be an important mechanism in this
                 context. However, it is also common to find
                 sex-specific variation in behavior and cognition
                 without associated differences in brain morphology
                 among the sexes. The telencephalon is the major
                 cognitive center in the vertebrate brain and variation
                 in telencephalon size has been associated with
                 variation in cognition. Here, we utilize recently
                 developed guppy artificial selection lines with ca.
                 10\% differences in relative telencephalon size to
                 investigate whether similar responses to selection of
                 the size of this region may affect cognitive abilities
                 differently in males and females. To that end, we
                 compared two ecologically relevant aspects of
                 cognition, detour learning and binary spatial
                 discrimination. We tested the significance of the
                 interaction between telencephalon size and sex, and we
                 found no sex-specific effects of evolutionary increases
                 in telencephalon size in the cognitive abilities
                 tested. This study indicates that no clear cognitive
                 sex-specific effects occur in response to rapid
                 selection of telencephalon size. We suggest that future
                 research on sexual dimorphism in cognitive abilities in
                 fish could use various cognitive tests and examine
                 telencephalic sub-regions to gain a more comprehensive
                 understanding of their evolution.",

                 between the two treatment groups. The size of the
                 olfactory bulbs and tegmentum varied significantly
                 between the treatment groups, which suggest differences
                 in primary, secondary, or tertiary sensory processing

                 studies on acute responses to environmental conditions
                 cannot inform true adaptation across broad timescales,
                 understanding the effects of increased temperature on
                 the brain phenotype can aid in predicting how
                 elasmobranchs may fare in response to changing ocean

  abstract =     "Grouper aquaculture is a rapidly growing and dynamic
                 industry within the Taiwan aquaculture sector that
                 serves as an important source of income generation.
                 Farming fishes at a better location (FFABL) is a
                 promising production strategy. This study evaluated the
                 production and economic performance of grouper farming
                 in Taiwan. This investigation employed two steps: (1) a
                 cost--benefit analysis to determine the main component
                 affecting profitability; and (2) multivariate
                 statistics to clarify the relationship between
                 biological and economic factors. The findings suggest
                 that the best choice of species is hybrid giant grouper
                 that generates and highlights a positive income, viable
                 benefit--cost ratio and profit rate. The study found
                 the feed management of hybrid giant groupers requires
                 more consideration due to its low feed conversion
                 ratio. The producers need to replace trash fish in
                 commercial feed during the production cycle to ensure
                 better feed management. Finally, this paper argues that
                 feed is the main constraint for grouper farming, which
                 is sensitive to any change in feed productivity, and
                 this constraint must be solved to sustain the grouper
                 industry in Taiwan.",

  abstract =     "Anthropogenic activities increase turbidity in coastal
                 marine environments globally, and turbidity is
                 particularly caused by eutrophication. Turbidity is a
                 measurement of the scattering and absorption of light
                 by suspended matter in water. An increase in turbidity
                 influences visual predators and affects community
                 structures and whole ecosystems. The three-spined
                 stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a widespread
                 species in the northern hemispheric Pacific and
                 Atlantic oceans. It is a visual predator and,
                 therefore, a very well-suited species for studying the
                 effects of increasing turbidity on foraging behaviour
                 and activity. Sticklebacks used for this study were
                 from an aquarium in the North Sea Oceanarium. They have
                 been in the aquarium for around two months and were
                 originally collected in a highly eutrophicated marine
                 fjord system. They were individually placed in an
                 observation aquarium, fed with krill, given 10 min to
                 forage, and observed by video cameras. The video films
                 were analysed to study stickleback predation behaviour.
                 Experiments were repeated with four different turbidity
                 treatments, ranging from a mean of 0.034 up to 10 NTU
                 (nephelometric turbidity unit). Bentonite clay was used
                 as a turbidity-increasing substance. A statistically
                 significant difference in foraging behaviour and
                 activity between the turbidity treatments was observed.
                 The test subjects were found to lunge less for prey and
                 had a higher feeding latency with increasing turbidity.
                 Additionally, they were less active with increasing
                 turbidity. The behavioural instability estimated as a
                 variation in feeding latency increased with increasing
                 turbidity but decreased at the highest turbidity value.
                 Our study indicates an effect of turbidity-increasing
                 events on the behaviour of the three-spined stickleback
                 and potentially also other similar visual predators.",

                 intake and maintaining energy balance in mammals. While
                 several studies have shown the presence of multiple
                 leptin genes in teleosts, limited information is
                 currently available on how sex steroid hormones
                 regulate the expression of these genes in fish. In this

                 leptin proteins to incubate four tissues in vitro
                 (hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and liver) and
                 used the RT-qPCR method to detect the expression of
                 genes related to growth and reproduction in tongue sole
                 (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The results showed that both
                 recombinant LepA and LepB proteins of tongue sole
                 almost entirely suppressed the expression of genes
                 related to growth and reproduction in the
                 hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and liver, while
                 LepB may have had a positive role on steroid synthesis
                 in gonads. Further, a high concentration of LepA
                 facilitated the expression of IGF-{\Iota} in liver. At
                 the same time, we utilized human leptin to incubate
                 four tissues in vitro; although most of them had trends
                 similar to those stimulated with tongue sole leptins,
                 there were still some differences, indicating
                 differences among leptin homologs between humans and
                 fishes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
                 explore the function of tongue sole LepA and LepB
                 within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and

                 alternatives to conventional fish meals in fish feed,
                 and insect-based meals are proving to be a promising
                 solution. These meals are nutritionally optimal as they
                 have a high protein content and an ideal amino acid
                 profile. However, the presence of chitin, a component
                 of the insect exoskeleton in these meals presents both
                 an opportunity and a challenge. Chitosan, a derivative
                 of chitin, is known to improve the physiological
                 functions of fish, including growth, immunity, and
                 disease resistance. While chitin and its derivative
                 chitosan offer several physiological benefits, their
                 presence can affect the digestibility of feed in some
                 fish species, making the inclusion of insect-based
                 meals in aquafeeds complex. While studies suggest

                 further research on chitin digestion in fish.
                 Chitinase, an enzyme that breaks down chitin, is being
                 investigated as a potential solution to improve the

                 fisheries is a critical foundation for conducting stock
                 assessment and fishery conservation. The Pacific
                 sardine (Sardinops sagax) is one of the economically
                 important fish species in the Northwest Pacific Ocean
                 (NPO). Hence, the importance of choosing an appropriate
                 CPUE standardization model cannot be overstated when it
                 comes to achieving a precise relative abundance index
                 for the efficient management of Pacific sardine
                 fishery. This study's main aim was to assess and
                 compare the efficacy of three models, specifically the
                 General Linear Model (GLM), the Generalized Linear
                 Mixed Model (GLMM), and the spatio-temporal GLMM
                 (VAST), in the CPUE standardization for Pacific sardine
                 fishery in the NPO, with the ultimate goal of
                 identifying the most appropriate model. An influence
                 analysis was applied to analyze the impact of
                 individual variables on the disparity among
                 standardized and nominal CPUE, and the main explanatory
                 variables influencing standardized CPUE were
                 identified. A coefficient--distribution--influence
                 (CDI) plot was generated to analyze the impact of the
                 different models on the annual standardized CPUE.
                 Additionally, a simulation testing framework was
                 developed to evaluate the estimated accuracy of the
                 three models. The results indicated that the
                 standardized CPUE and the nominal CPUE exhibited
                 similar trends between 2014 and 2021 for the three
                 models. Compared to the GLM and the GLMM, the VAST
                 demonstrates larger conditional R 2 and smaller
                 conditional AIC, indicating a better performance in
                 standardizing the CPUE for Pacific sardines due to its
                 consideration of spatial and temporal variations. The
                 interaction terms within the three models exert
                 significant influences on the annual standardized CPUE,
                 necessitating their inclusion in the model
                 construction. CDI plots indicate that the
                 spatio-temporal influence of the VAST model exhibits a
                 smaller variation trend, suggesting that the VAST is
                 more robust when standardizing the CPUE for Pacific
                 sardines. Simulation testing additionally demonstrated
                 that the VAST model displays smaller model root mean
                 squared error (RMSE) and bias, establishing it as the
                 superior performer for standardizing CPUE. Our results
                 provide a theoretical basis for the scientific
                 management of Pacific sardines in the NPO and can be
                 extended to CPUE standardization for other small
                 pelagic fish species worldwide.",

                 performance of post-larval (PL) P. vannamei fed nursery
                 diets with a progressive replacement of fish meal (FML)
                 for BSFLM at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\%. These
                 replacements corresponded to a dietary inclusion (\% of
                 the diet, as-is) of FML and BSFLM of 16.50 and 6.33\%,
                 11.00 and 13.04\%, 5.50 and 19.74\%, and 0 and 26.46\%,
                 respectively. A total of 102,647 shrimp at the age of
                 PL15 with 2.7 {\pm} 0.2 mg body weight (BW) were
                 stocked in fifty 1.5 m 3 tanks under 1369 PLs/m 3 (2053
                 {\pm} 33 PLs/tank) and reared for 42 days. Final shrimp
                 survival (90.5 {\pm} 7.6\%), daily weight gain (14.7
                 {\pm} 1.1 mg/day), and apparent feed intake (0.67 {\pm}
                 0.03 g of feed per stocked shrimp) were unaffected by
                 dietary treatment. The highest gained yield (791 {\pm}
                 52 and 776 {\pm} 38 g/m 3) and final BW (621 {\pm} 7.2
                 and 632 {\pm} 7.2 mg) were attained when FML was
                 replaced for BSFLM at 50 and 75\% with the lowest at
                 0\% (726 {\pm} 34 g/m 3 and 598 {\pm} 8.1 mg,
                 respectively). Shrimp fed diets with 0 and 100\%
                 replacement of FML exhibited the highest feed
                 conversion ratio (1.25 {\pm} 0.04 and 1.24 {\pm} 0.08)
                 compared to those fed a diet with 50\% (1.16 {\pm}
                 0.06). At a price of USD 2.00/kg, BSFLM demonstrated a
                 favorable ROI (return of investment) when compared to
                 FML, irrespective of the replacement level. With 25 and
                 50\% replacement, BSFLM remained cost-competitive up to
                 3.50 USD/kg. At 75\% FML replacement, there were no
                 significant differences in ROI with a price range of
                 2.00 up to 3.04 USD/kg. At full replacement, ROI
                 dropped significantly at a BSFLM price of 2.50 USD/kg
                 and beyond. It can be concluded that FML can be fully
                 replaced for BSFLM in well-balanced nursery diets for
                 P. vannamei. Although the full replacement of FML for
                 BSFLM was successfully accomplished, the competitive
                 ROI was sustained only when the price of BSFLM did not
                 exceed 3.04 USD/kg at its dietary highest inclusion of
                 19.74\%. Further research may be necessary to fine-tune
                 cost-effective inclusion levels of BSFLM to optimize
                 the economic outcomes while considering the fluctuating
                 prices of FML.",

                 traditional Chinese medicine, as well as for the
                 aquarium trade as ornamentals and curiosities. To
                 balance market demand and reduce pressure on wild
                 populations, many countries have undertaken commercial
                 seahorse cultivation. Skeletal development plays a
                 crucial role in fish fry culture, affecting external
                 morphology, feeding, and movement. This study
                 investigated the ontogeny allometry, timing, and
                 progression of skeletal development in H. abdominalis
                 from DAB (day after birth) 1 to DAB 100 under
                 mass-scale captive breeding conditions in north China.
                 The results of this study revealed the growth rate was
                 significantly increased between DAB 30 and DAB 54.
                 Allometry analysis revealed that in the early stage,
                 the head, trunk, and tail demonstrated almost isometric
                 growth. However, in the later stage, the head and trunk
                 exhibited negative isometric growth, whereas the tail
                 displayed positive isometric growth. Skeletal staining
                 results showed that newborn seahorses do not have
                 ossified bones until DAB 11 (SL 28.14 {\pm} 2.94 mm).
                 Ossification was primarily observed in the jaw region
                 and the tubular nasal structure of the cranium, which
                 indicated the importance of the early development of
                 feeding organs. The initial formation of ossified
                 vertebral columns was observed at DAB 13 (SL 26.48
                 {\pm} 0.63 mm), with the complete ossification of all
                 vertebrae occurring by DAB 45 (SL 54.87 {\pm} 4.70 mm).
                 Furthermore, the cranium, rings, and plates were all
                 fully ossified by DAB 30. Ossification of the fins
                 began at DAB 23 (SL 31.27 {\pm} 4.05 mm). However,
                 neither of them were fully ossified by DAB 100. The
                 pelvic fin and the complete structure of the caudal fin
                 were not observed, possibly because of caudal fin ray
                 structure degeneration within the pouch. In addition,
                 no skeletal deformities were observed in all the tested
                 samples. The results of this study provide valuable
                 information on the developmental biology of H.
                 abdominalis, enriching our understanding of their
                 growth and offering insights for optimizing fish fry

                 fishing endeavors holds significant importance in the
                 context of monitoring fishery resources and
                 implementing spatial management measures. To gain
                 insights into the spatial arrangement of tuna longline
                 activities within the exclusive economic zones of Tonga
                 and their correlation with the marine environment, this
                 study utilizes data from the Tonga Tuna Longline
                 Fisheries spanning from 2002 to 2018. The data are
                 employed to extract information about the spatial
                 distribution of fishing efforts and coupled with 15
                 marine environmental variables covering both sea
                 surface and subsurface conditions. This study employs
                 boosted regression trees (BRT) and general additive
                 models (GAM) to establish the non-linear relationships
                 between the distribution of fishing effort and marine
                 environmental factors. Furthermore, it examines and
                 analyzes the ecological niche occupied by tuna longline
                 vessels in high-sea environments. The outcomes of the
                 factor analysis indicate that the most important
                 factors influencing the fishing efforts of tuna
                 longliners are the dissolved oxygen content at the sea
                 surface and latitude. These two factors contribute
                 significantly, accounting for 19.06\% and 18.62\% of
                 the fishing efforts of vessels, respectively, followed
                 by distance to ports, longitude, and dissolved oxygen
                 at 100 m depth, contributing 10.77\%, 7.07\%, and
                 6.30\%, respectively. The sea surface chlorophyll,
                 ocean current at 100 m depth, and mixed layer depth
                 contributed the least, 3.63\%, 2.13\%, and 1.72,
                 respectively. In terms of space and time, tuna
                 longliners are more likely to operate in the
                 18--{22$^\circ $} S latitudinal and 172--{178$^\circ $}
                 W longitudinal region, and fishing efforts increased in
                 the months from March to August. The spatial
                 distribution of the fishing efforts modeled for fishing
                 vessels in 2018 is predicted to have good spatial
                 distribution with the actual fishing efforts of these
                 vessels. This research aids in comprehending the
                 environmental impacts resulting from shifts in the
                 spatial distribution of tuna longline vessels, offering
                 valuable insights for the effective management of tuna

  abstract =     "Global change produces substantial modification to the
                 distribution and rhythm of infection of diseases in
                 fish, favouring the introduction of new pathogens.
                 Recently, the presence of black spot disease,
                 associated with a digenean fluke of the genus
                 Scaphanocephalus, has been observed in specimens of
                 Xyrichthys novacula on the island of Ibiza (Balearic
                 Islands). The aim of the present study was to evaluate
                 the antioxidant and immune response in both the skin
                 mucus and spleen of X. novacula depending on the degree
                 of infection by Scaphanocephalus sp. The specimens were
                 captured in a control area, without the presence of the
                 parasite, and in an affected area, classifying the fish
                 as low infection (1--15 spots) and high infection
                 ({$>$15} spots). As the degree of infection increased,
                 a decrease in the body condition index was observed.
                 The activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the
                 mucus---catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione
                 peroxidase---increased progressively with the degree of
                 infection. This activation of antioxidant defences was
                 not enough to prevent an increase in malondialdehyde
                 levels, an indicator of oxidative damage, in the group
                 with the highest infection. Similarly, an increase in
                 immunological parameters---lysozyme, alkaline
                 phosphatase, myeloperoxidase and immunoglobulins---was
                 observed in mucus as infection increased. Regarding the
                 spleen, only an increase in lysozyme activity and
                 alkaline phosphatase in fish with a greater severity of
                 infection was observed. In conclusion, as the severity
                 of Scaphanocephalus sp. infection increased, it induced
                 an immune and oxidative stress response in skin mucus,
                 leading to a decrease in overall body condition. The

  abstract =     "Ecosystem alterations to Lake Michigan (LM), such as
                 the invasion of dreissenid mussels, have decreased the
                 abundance of phytoplankton and, subsequently,
                 zooplankton, which has implications for Great Lake
                 fisheries. The community composition of zooplankton has
                 also been altered over the past 20 years in LM,
                 shifting the summer dominance from cladoceran to
                 calanoid taxa. However, most of our information on
                 zooplankton community dynamics is from deeper pelagic
                 zones. The nearshore beach ({\leq}1 m) habitat, which
                 serves as a critical nursery for some larvae and
                 juvenile fish, is composed of different zooplankton
                 taxa than deeper zones, but limited data are available
                 for comparison. We conducted a standardized summer
                 sampling campaign to characterize the zooplankton
                 community across 32 beaches in LM. We found the lowest
                 crustacean zooplankton density and biomass on northern
                 LM beaches and a higher zooplankton density and biomass
                 on Greater Green Bay and central LM beaches, which had
                 warmer water temperatures. Smaller-bodied cladocera
                 (mainly Bosmina) and cyclopoid taxa were the most
                 abundant groups on beaches. Our results provide the
                 first comprehensive characterization of zooplankton on
                 beaches in the Great Lakes, with applications for other
                 lake systems. These results may help identify potential

  abstract =     "Massive macroalgae blooms, primarily caused by the
                 overgrowth of Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera) in the
                 Yellow Sea of China, pose a severe risk to both marine
                 organisms and the aquaculture industry. This study's
                 aim was to evaluate the impact of U. prolifera
                 degradation on the growth performance and antioxidant
                 capacity of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)
                 and select some potential Japanese flounder families
                 (labeled 2101--2108, established by crossbreeding)
                 tolerating U. prolifera degradation conditions. Thus, a
                 60-day U. prolifera exposure experiment was conducted.
                 The results showed that the contents of Na, K, Mg, and
                 Fe elements in the U. prolifera degradation water were
                 significantly increased. The specific growth rate and
                 survival rate of flounder were significantly decreased
                 under the U. prolifera degradation condition, while the
                 2101 and 2103 flounder families showed a better growth
                 performance compared with the positive control (PC)
                 group. Moreover, the results showed that activities of
                 total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), transaminases, and
                 alkaline phosphatase (AKP) in serum were significantly
                 decreased, while the 2103 flounder family showed higher
                 activities. Furthermore, U. prolifera degradation
                 significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)
                 activity and glutathione (GSH) content while decreasing
                 catalase (CAT) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA)
                 content in the liver. Specifically, SOD and CAT
                 activities of the 2103 flounder family were higher than
                 the 2101 flounder family and PC group. In addition, the
                 gill SOD and CAT activities of the 2103 flounder family
                 were significantly higher than the PC group. Similarly,
                 the antioxidant-related gene (sod and cat) expressions
                 were synchronously upregulated or downregulated in the
                 liver and gills in response to U. prolifera
                 degradation. These results revealed that U. prolifera
                 degradation decreased the growth performance and
                 influenced the antioxidant capacity of Japanese
                 flounder, while the 2103 flounder family had better
                 advantages in the U. prolifera degradation condition.
                 Therefore, the 2103 flounder family could be regarded
                 as the potential flounder family tolerating U.
                 prolifera degradation. The increased Fe content in the
                 U. prolifera degradation water may be one of the main
                 causes of the physiological alterations observed in
                 Japanese flounder.",

  abstract =     "The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a
                 central and multifaceted mediator in innate immunity,
                 and plays vital roles in defending against pathogen
                 infection. In this study, we identified and
                 functionally characterized the STING homolog from the
                 Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus (AdSTING)
                 for the first time. The open reading frame of AdSTING
                 encodes a 362 amino acid protein with a predicted
                 molecular mass of 41.6 kDa, which shares 31.1--46.7\%
                 of its sequence identity with STING homologs in other
                 vertebrates. Structural analysis revealed that AdSTING
                 possesses four predicted transmembrane domains (TMs) at
                 the N-terminal, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) featuring
                 a dimerization domain (DD), a c-di-GMP-binding domain
                 (CBD), and a short C-terminal tail (CTT). Tissue
                 distribution analysis showed that AdSTING mRNA was
                 ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, with
                 abundant expression in muscles, intestine, and thymus.
                 During Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV) infection,
                 significant up-regulation of AdSTING expression was
                 observed in the thymus, spleen, and kidney. Upon
                 different stimuli in vitro, the expression of AdSTING
                 was significantly induced by ADRV infection or
                 polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation,
                 but no obvious changes were observed during
                 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Subcellular
                 localization analysis revealed that AdSTING mainly
                 localized in the cytoplasm in the Chinese giant
                 salamander thymus cell line (GSTC) and co-localized
                 with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Luciferase
                 reporter assays confirmed the ability of AdSTING to
                 activate the interferon-stimulated response element
                 (ISRE) and interferon (IFN) promoter. Furthermore,
                 overexpression of AdSTING effectively decreased ADRV
                 infection, as evidenced by the reduction of virus
                 titers and viral gene expression. Collectively, our
                 findings underscore the pivotal role of AdSTING in the
                 antiviral innate immunity of the Chinese giant
                 salamander, offering insights into the functional
                 evolution of STING in amphibians.",

                 decrease in ectothermic fish body size, the mechanisms
                 driving this phenomenon remain a subject of scientific
                 debate. This study, utilizing the Atlantic cod (Gadus
                 morhua) as a model organism, delves into the behavioral
                 size-dependent temperature preference in the context of
                 climate change. A significant negative correlation
                 between temperature preference and fish size was
                 discovered, aligning with in situ habitat temperatures
                 and optimal physiological performance metrics from
                 other studies. This correlation suggests that larger
                 fish exhibit a behavioral preference for colder areas,
                 potentially leading to shifts in distribution toward
                 polar regions or deeper waters in response to local
                 global warming. The findings contribute to predictions

                 critical role of size-dependent temperature preference
                 in shaping fish populations and offering valuable

                 cues for organisms, and it plays a crucial role in
                 regulating feeding, behavior, growth, and metabolism.
                 However, seasonal photoperiods are often overlooked in
                 carp culture or experiments, with a poorly understood
                 effect on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in
                 fish. To explore the effects of seasonal photoperiods,
                 we exposed Huanghe carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus)
                 to summer photoperiod (14 h light:10 h dark) and winter
                 photoperiod (10 h light:14 h dark) daylight conditions
                 in an eight-week experiment. Our results suggested that
                 the winter photoperiod significantly increased the
                 liver TG level as well as the transcript levels of
                 genes related to lipid synthesis, indicating that the
                 lipid metabolism in Huanghe carp liver was enhanced
                 compared to summer photoperiod conditions, and that
                 lipid deposition may be responsible for the increase in
                 body weight level and hepatosomatic index.
                 Additionally, MDA, GSH, GSH-PX, and T-AOC levels were
                 significantly elevated in the liver of fish under the
                 winter photoperiod, suggesting that Huanghe carp
                 responded to winter photoperiod exposure-induced
                 oxidative stress in the liver by enhancing the
                 antioxidant response. Based on transcriptome analysis,
                 the winter photoperiod activated hepatic autophagy
                 response and the FOXO signaling pathway in Huanghe
                 carp. Combined with the correlation analysis, the
                 Huanghe carp maintains the physiological health of the
                 liver by activating the FOXO signaling pathway-mediated
                 cell cycle regulation and autophagy response in
                 response to oxidative stress during winter photoperiod
                 exposure. Our study provides the first evidence for the

                 strongest T-AOC and inhibitory effect on the lipid
                 oxidation. Next, fish feeds were incubated with graded
                 levels of AE. The results showed that AE inhibited
                 lipid oxidation in fish feed. The appropriate dosage
                 for reducing lipid oxidation was 6.74 g AE kg {$-$1}
                 feeds. The effect of EAms on the lipid oxidation may be
                 closely associated with their phenolic content. Then,
                 juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian, 10.2
                 {\pm} 0.3 g) were fed with diets containing graded
                 levels of AE (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and
                 7.0 g kg {$-$1}) for 60 days. Current data displayed
                 that dietary AE increased the growth performance of
                 fish. The optimum dosage for growth promotion was 5.15
                 g AE kg {$-$1} diet. This result of AE may be ascribed
                 to its enhancing effect on the activity of digestive
                 and absorptive enzymes and antioxidant capacity in
                 digestive organs of fish. Our present study indicated
                 that EAm holds promise as a natural antioxidant for
                 fish and their feed.",

                 asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis, YFP) is an endangered
                 species endemic to the Yangtze River in China, and it
                 is the only freshwater whale in the genus Neophocaena.
                 In terms of protection, three effective conservation
                 strategies exist: in situ conservation, ex situ
                 conservation, and artificial breeding, all of which
                 have been implemented by the Chinese government. Of
                 these, ex situ conservation involves the relocation of
                 Yangtze finless porpoises to semi-natural waters with
                 less human interference, and artificial breeding
                 involves the relocation of Yangtze finless porpoises to
                 a controlled environment that is more strictly managed.
                 To compare and analyze the responsive changes in gene
                 expression of the YFPs between the ex situ and
                 controlled environments, we performed the RNA
                 sequencing of blood tissues from these YFPs. A total of
                 1201 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
                 identified, of which 423 were up-regulated in the ex
                 situ population and 778 were up-regulated in the
                 controlled-environment population. Gene enrichment
                 analysis showed that 1201 DEGs between the ex situ and
                 controlled-environment populations were generally
                 enriched for vision-, digestion- and
                 immune-system-related pathways. Further analysis
                 revealed that several key immune system pathways, such
                 as the chemokine signaling pathway and B cell receptor
                 signal pathway, were activated in the ex situ
                 population. In addition, the key pathways related to
                 vision, including phototransduction and the
                 inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, as
                 well as the pathways related to the digestive system,
                 such as protein digestion and absorption and salivary
                 secretion, were activated in the controlled-environment
                 population. These results suggest that the ex situ
                 populations may respond to complex environmental
                 conditions in semi-natural waters by enhancing their
                 immune function through the increased expression of
                 immune-related genes and that the visual function and
                 protein digestion of the YFPs were improved compared to
                 those of the ex situ population based on the conditions
                 of artificial feeding, such as the higher transparency
                 of the water and regular feeding. This study provides
                 clues for evaluating the adaptability of YFPs to
                 different environments and is a useful reference for
                 future ex situ conservation and artificial breeding.",

                 critical technologies for large-scale fishery farming
                 when trying to achieve accurate, green farming and
                 sustainable development. It is an essential link for
                 aquaculture to move toward automation and intelligence.
                 However, existing fish individual data collection
                 methods cannot cope with the interference of light,
                 blur, and pose in the natural underwater environment,
                 which makes the captured fish individual images of poor
                 quality. These low-quality images can cause significant
                 interference with the training of recognition networks.
                 In order to solve the above problems, this paper
                 proposes an underwater fish individual recognition
                 method (FishFace) that combines data quality assessment
                 and loss weighting. First, we introduce the Gem pooing
                 and quality evaluation module, which is based on
                 EfficientNet. This module is an improved fish
                 recognition network that can evaluate the quality of
                 fish images well, and it does not need additional
                 labels; second, we propose a new loss function,
                 FishFace Loss, which will weigh the loss according to
                 the quality of the image so that the model focuses more
                 on recognizable fish images, and less on images that
                 are difficult to recognize. Finally, we collect a
                 dataset for fish individual recognition (WideFish),
                 which contains and annotates 5000 images of 300 fish.
                 The experimental results show that, compared with the
                 state-of-the-art individual recognition methods, Rank1
                 accuracy is improved by 2.60\% and 3.12\% on the public

                 levels (0\%, 2.5\%, 5\%) in plant-based and
                 animal-based feeds, that were fishmeal (FM) and fish
                 oil (FO) free, on Atlantic salmon growth. A FM/FO feed
                 containing 0\% KM was the control. Using a 2 $ \times $
                 3 factorial approach, diets were randomly assigned to
                 one of 28 0.5 m 3 flow-through tanks (n = 4 tanks per

                 feeders ad libitum. On day 45, stocking densities were
                 reduced to 45 fish per tank by the random removal of 15
                 individuals to remove any potential of density
                 affecting growth through the trial end. Water
                 temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, and salinity
                 throughout the trial were 11.8 {$^\circ $}C, 103.5\%,
                 7.38, and 32.0 g L {$-$1}, respectively. Fish fed
                 plant-based feed without KM were lighter (p {$<$} 0.05)
                 than all other groups at day 45 and 90, but those fed a
                 plant-based feed with KM had comparable growth and feed
                 intake compared to that of fish fed the control diet.
                 Irrespective of the presence of KM, animal-based feeds
                 achieved comparable weight growth (p {$>$} 0.05) to the
                 control and 5\% KM plant-based groups, with KM
                 increasing feed intake (p {$<$} 0.05). Between day 45
                 and 90, feed conversion ratios increased in all groups
                 except the control and 0\% KM plant-based group, while
                 specific growth rates (SGRs) decreased for all except
                 the 0\% KM plant-based diet. Between-group differences
                 (p {$<$} 0.05) were also noted for the thermal growth
                 coefficient. No differences were recorded in visceral
                 or intestinal weight, and whole-body lipid levels were
                 identical, proportional for all groups. Although
                 differences (p {$<$} 0.05) were apparent in the
                 concentrations of individual fillet fatty acids between
                 groups, a 75 g serving size of any treatment would be
                 sufficient to exceed daily intake recommendations for
                 EPA + DHA. This trial determined that benefit, in terms
                 of feed intake and growth performance, was gained when
                 KM was added to plant-based feeds. However, no such

  abstract =     "Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential element with
                 sub-lethal effects even at low concentrations. The
                 persistent nature of Cd and its tendency to
                 bioaccumulate eventually create harmful effects on
                 water biota, including fish. Cd affects various aspects
                 of hormonal action in fish since it bioaccumulates in
                 the endocrine system and hinders the synthesis,
                 secretion, and metabolic activity of hormones, causing
                 severe damage along the
                 hypothalamus--pituitary--gonadal axis. Linking
                 reproductive and developmental impairments in fish with
                 ecologically relevant concentrations of individual
                 metals can be challenging due to the complexity of
                 aquatic ecosystems. This review deliberated the
                 significant and novel trends of toxicological
                 difficulties and approaches, including elucidating
                 environmental sources' bioavailability and Cd-induced
                 toxic effects in freshwater fish. Both acute and
                 chronic exposure to Cd can cause a range of adverse
                 effects, such as growth inhibition, impaired
                 reproductive capacity, endocrine disruption, and
                 developmental abnormalities in freshwater fish, as
                 evidenced by the present review. These investigations
                 support the concept of Cd as a naturally available
                 pollutant that causes irreversible damage in fish.
                 These findings will help to understand the etiology of

                 (Litopenaeus vannamei). Bio-products of E. prolifera
                 included E. prolifera meal, E. prolifera hydrolysate
                 and E. prolifera polysaccharide, which was supplied
                 using different processing procedures. The control diet
                 was supplemented without any E. prolifera bio-products
                 or dietary attractants. Experimental diets were
                 formulated to contain 0.2\% and 0.4\% of E. prolifera
                 hydrolysate (EPH0.2\% and EPH0.4\%), 0.03\% of E.

                 (SP1\%). Shrimp ($ \approx $8 g) were randomly
                 distributed in 21 tanks and fed for 44 days. Feed
                 intake showed that 3\% of E. prolifera meal and 0.4\%
                 of E. prolifera hydrolysate in diets exhibited similar
                 attractant effects as 0.1\% of DMPT. Gross qualitative
                 observation showed that the abundance of lipid droplets
                 decreased in hepatopancreas of the EPH0.4\% and EPM3\%
                 groups, which were supported by hepatopancreas
                 triacylglycerol (TG), where significantly lower
                 concentrations were observed in the EPH0.4\% and EPM3\%
                 groups compared with the control group. Similarly, TG
                 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum
                 significantly decreased in the EPH0.4\%, EPP0.03\% and
                 EPM3\% groups compared to the control group.
                 Supplemental E. prolifera bio-products resulted in
                 significantly higher serum glutathione level of
                 EPP0.03\% or superoxide dismutase activities of

  abstract =     "Oysters have the potential to be a part of more
                 sustainable farming systems, such as multitrophic
                 systems integrated into biofloc systems, due to their
                 filtration activity, which enables them to act as
                 organic consumers. However, the stress experienced by
                 animals in a system with a high organic load can
                 compromise their productive performance. The objective
                 of this study was to evaluate the biological responses
                 of Crassostrea gasar oysters when exposed to different
                 concentrations of total suspended solids in biofloc
                 systems. The oysters were exposed to four different
                 concentrations of solids for 28 days. Hall effect
                 sensors were installed on the outside of the shells to
                 detect the movement of the oyster valves. Also,
                 biochemical and histological analyses were conducted to
                 assess the biological responses of the oysters to
                 exposure to varying levels of solids. A difference in
                 valve opening detected by the Hall sensors was observed
                 from the second week of culture, indicating a
                 relationship between shell closure and higher
                 concentrations of suspended solids present in the
                 system. In terms of biochemical analysis, a significant
                 increase in lipid damage was observed in treatments
                 with medium and high levels of total suspended solids
                 compared with the control group. Conversely, no changes
                 were observed in the gill structure of the oysters
                 caused by the concentrations of suspended solids in the
                 system when compared with the control. According to the
                 analyses of gill activity and biochemistry, it is
                 suggested that C. gasar should be cultured with total
                 suspended solids at less than 200 mg/L. Oysters
                 cultivated in a biofloc system keep their shells closed
                 when subjected to high concentrations of total
                 suspended solids; concentrations of total suspended
                 solids below 200 mg/L do not induce oxidative stress,
                 changes in behavior or histological alterations in C.

                 species in the Indo-Pacific region, Albula glossodonta

                 collected A. glossodonta fin clips from the main

                 Population genomics was conducted based on 208

                 healthy food production, low trophic species, such as
                 oysters, emerge as a promising alternative. However,
                 regional variations in oyster production techniques,
                 market dynamics, and consumption patterns create
                 challenges for both the global and local industry's
                 growth. In this study, a descriptive qualitative
                 analysis of oyster markets across seven Atlantic
                 regions was carried out. The Pacific oyster
                 (Crassostrea gigas) was found to be farmed in most
                 Atlantic regions except the US but is classified as
                 invasive in Sweden and potentially invasive in South
                 Africa. Other farmed and/or harvested species include
                 native species (C. gasar and C. rhizophorae) in Brazil,
                 the American cupped oyster (C. virginica) in the US,
                 and the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) in France,
                 Sweden, and the US. In Irish farms, Pacific oysters are
                 primarily for export to European markets. The marine
                 aquaculture sectors of Sweden, South Africa, and
                 Namibia, as well as Brazil's farming for C. gasar, were
                 found to be underdeveloped. This study also observed a
                 variation in licensing, property rights, and regulatory
                 frameworks. Financial challenges for small businesses,
                 ecological implications of seed production techniques,
                 biosecurity risks, and public health considerations are
                 emphasized as critical areas for attention. This study
                 offers valuable insights into the selected markets and
                 can serve as a useful resource for policymakers,

                 fusion results in a singular and saccular ovary, where
                 the germinal epithelium lines the internal lumen. The
                 present study aimed to identify the immune cells in the
                 ovarian stroma of Molly fish during the breeding season
                 using histological and immunohistochemical analysis.
                 Histological examination of the ovaries displayed
                 oocytes at all different stages of development and
                 degeneration. The ovocoel, a lymph-filled space,
                 remains in the center of the ovary and branches
                 posteriorly, creating the lumen of the gonoduct. The
                 ovarian wall is composed of three layers: the
                 mesothelium, tunica albuginea, and germinal epithelium.
                 The developing ova were held together by the stroma,
                 which consisted of vascular collagenous connective
                 tissue clustered with immune cells. Immunohistochemical
                 analysis revealed the presence of clusters of
                 macrophages expressing APG5, IL-1{\beta}, TGF-{\beta},
                 S100, NF-{\kappa}B, CD68, Iba-1, and Ach. Monocytes
                 demonstrated positive immunoreactivity for both APG5
                 and IL-1{\beta}, whereas dendritic cells expressed only
                 APG5. Furthermore, rodlet cells exhibited
                 immunoreactivity for S100 protein, IL-1{\beta},
                 NF-{\kappa}B, CD68, Nrf2, Ach, myostatin, SOX9, and
                 Iba-1. In contrast, stem cells displayed
                 immunoreactivity for Nrf2, myostatin, and SOX9. In
                 conclusion, the ovarian stroma of Molly fish
                 demonstrated a notable presence of immune cells,
                 indicating their active involvement in immune
                 reactions.",

  abstract =     "Obtaining viable Argopecten purpuratus seeds faces
                 challenges, especiallyci the unpredictability of the
                 marine environment and high production costs in
                 hatcheries. However, improving the method of
                 ``Broodstock Conditioning In Hatcheries'' is key to
                 ensure permanent seed supplies by minimizing the
                 dependence on marine conditions and by maximizing
                 economic viability in hatcheries. In an effort to
                 overcome these barriers, broodstock were conditioned
                 into two different environments: (a) Natural
                 Environment: Natural marine conditions located in
                 Bah{\'\i}a Inglesa, Atacama Region, Chile. (b)
                 Hatchery: Laboratory conditions to achieve gonadal
                 maturation, spawning induction, fertilization and
                 larval development. The purpose of this research was to
                 evaluate how the type of reproductive conditioning
                 affects the reproductive potential and nutritional
                 quality of the progeny. Both methods were successful at
                 inducing the necessary maturity for reproduction,
                 obtaining viable gametes and larvae. On the other hand,
                 it was observed that in the natural environment, the
                 oocytes and D larvae reached a greater size and
                 nutritional value, being the most significant
                 differences with (p {$<$} 0.05): the size of the D
                 larvae reached figures of 95.8 {\pm} 3.1 {\mu}m and
                 91.2 {\pm} 2.7 {\mu}m in the environment and hatchery,
                 respectively; the lipid content in dry mass was 25.2
                 {\pm} 3.1 mg g {$-$1} and 13.5 {\pm} 1.9 mg g {$-$1}
                 for the natural environment and hatchery, respectively.
                 Although quality indicators in hatcheries were slightly
                 lower compared to the natural environment, the
                 possibility of conditioning A. purpuratus broodstock
                 independently of environmental variability highlights
                 the importance of further optimizing broodstock
                 conditioning aspects in hatcheries that would allow
                 more predictable and sustainable production.",

  abstract =     "Lakes in the High Arctic are characterized by their
                 low water temperature, long-term ice cover, low levels
                 of nutrients, and low biodiversity. These conditions
                 mean that minor climatic changes may be of great
                 importance to Arctic freshwater organisms, including
                 fish, by influencing vital life history parameters such
                 as individual growth rates. In this study, Arctic charr
                 sampled from two Svalbard lakes (78--{79$^\circ $} N)
                 over the period 1960--2008 provided back-calculated
                 length-at-age information extending over six decades,
                 covering both warm and cold spells. The estimated
                 annual growth in young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic charr
                 correlated positively with an increasing air
                 temperature in summer. This increase is likely due to
                 the higher water temperature during the ice-free
                 period, and also to some extent, due to the winter air
                 temperature; this is probably due to thinner ice being
                 formed in mild winters and the subsequent earlier ice
                 break-up. However, years with higher snow accumulation
                 correlated with slower growth rates, which may be due
                 to delayed ice break-up and thus a shorter summer
                 growing season. More than 30\% of the growth in YOY
                 charr could be explained specifically by air
                 temperature and snow accumulation in the two Arctic
                 charr populations. This indicated that juvenile
                 Svalbard Arctic charr may experience increased growth
                 rates in a future warmer climate, although future
                 increases in precipitation may contradict the positive
                 effects of higher temperatures to some extent. In the
                 longer term, a warmer climate may lead to the complete
                 loss of many glaciers in western Svalbard; therefore,
                 rivers may dry out, thus hindering migration between
                 salt water and fresh water for migratory fish. In the
                 worst-case scenario, the highly valuable and attractive
                 anadromous Arctic charr populations could eventually
                 disappear from the Svalbard lake systems.",

                 currently used to control these diseases pose
                 environmental and health risks. This study aimed to
                 screen for a probiotic Bacillus strain with
                 antagonistic activity to prevent and control bacterial
                 diseases in grass carp and to evaluate the
                 antimicrobial activities, biosafety, and biocontrol
                 effects of this strain. A Bacillus strain with
                 antagonistic activity against Aeromonas hydrophila,
                 obtained from grass carp intestines, was screened, and
                 the isolate CYS06 was identified by analyzing the 16S
                 rRNA and gyrA gene sequences. The antimicrobial
                 spectrum of the strain CYS06 was determined, and the
                 activities of amylase, cellulase, protease, and lipase
                 of the strain CYS06 were determined. The whole genome
                 of the strain CYS06 was sequenced using the nanopore
                 sequencing technology platform, followed by the
                 analysis of the antagonistic substance synthesis gene
                 clusters and CAZy enzyme gene families. The biosafety
                 of the strain CYS06 was evaluated via intraperitoneal
                 injection into healthy grass carp. After the strain
                 CYS06 was fed to the grass carp, its biological control
                 effect on this fish was evaluated through artificial
                 infection experiments. The strain CYS06 was identified
                 as Bacillus velezensis, based on molecular
                 identification, which shows broad antimicrobial
                 activity against various fish pathogens. The strain
                 CYS06 secretes amylase, cellulase, protease, and
                 lipase. The genome size of the strain CYS06 is
                 3,914,159 bp, and it contains eight antagonistic
                 substance synthesis gene clusters and many CAZy
                 enzymes. The strain CYS06 exhibits high biological
                 safety for grass carp, based on the challenge test.
                 Feeding grass carp with the strain CYS06 for 4 weeks
                 significantly enhanced the resistance of the fish to A.
                 hydrophila. Strain CYS06 could inhibit the growth of
                 Flavobacterium columnare under co-culture and reduce
                 the amount of F. columnare adherence on the gills of
                 grass carp, indicating that CYS06 has good potential
                 for the prevention and control of columnaris disease.
                 In conclusion, we isolated an antagonistic probiotic
                 strain, CYS06, which exhibits a biological control
                 effect on septicemia and columnaris disease caused by
                 Aeromonas spp. and F. columnare in grass carp,
                 respectively. This strain contains many antagonistic
                 substance synthesis-related gene clusters and holds the
                 potential to degrade various types of carbohydrates. As
                 a biological control agent, the strain CYS06 exhibits
                 significant potential for the prevention and control of
                 bacterial diseases in grass carp.",

                 ones, is of the utmost importance. Morphological
                 determination of species is usually not sufficient;
                 therefore, molecular phylogenetic analyses of the
                 Illyrian chub, Squalius illyricus, and the Zrmanja
                 chub, Squalius zrmanjae, from the Krka River were
                 performed. For the genetic characterization of the
                 mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and the non-coding
                 nuclear region Cyfun P, 15 specimens from each species
                 were subjected to analysis. The obtained sequences were
                 aligned with similar ones from GenBank to determine the
                 taxonomic and phylogenetic position of these species.
                 The obtained molecular results imply that S. zrmanjae
                 from the Krka River has a nuclear region that resembles
                 Dalmatian rudd, Scardinius dergle. This result implies
                 an introgression event and the transfer of genetic
                 information between the two genera. The investigated

  abstract =     "In group-living species, social interactions with
                 conspecifics play a crucial role in group formation and
                 the ability to make consensus decisions, with
                 far-reaching consequences for ecological and
                 evolutionary processes in natural populations.
                 Individual recognition and partner preferences based on
                 social familiarity are important mechanisms driving a
                 range of interactions between individual fish and
                 social structure in fish populations. However, the
                 social interactions of gregarious species are also
                 influenced by the ecological environment experienced by
                 individuals. This study aimed to determine how fish
                 shoals' structure is shaped by increased turbidity, a
                 typical environmental constraint in anthropogenically
                 impacted rivers. A freshwater, shoal-forming, visually
                 orientated pelagic fish---bleak (Alburnus
                 alburnus)---was used as the model organism. The
                 behavior of 40 individuals at three different turbidity
                 levels (0 NTU, 30 NTU, 60 NTU) was tested in the
                 laboratory experiment. Specifically, the aim was to
                 determine if the turbidity reduces between individual
                 distances in response to the deteriorated visual
                 conditions. The results showed that bleaks increased
                 the compactness of the shoal even at the medium
                 turbidity level (30 NTU), and compactness further
                 increased with turbidity. Such results indicate that
                 turbidity is an important phenomenon influencing the
                 structure of shoals and ultimately an ecological
                 process in natural fish populations in ecosystems
                 affected by increasing turbidity.",

                 that utilize multiple fishing gears to target various
                 species. In this study, we investigated small-scale
                 reef and demersal fisheries in Saleh Bay, Indonesia,
                 using catch and effort data from 2016 to 2019, where
                 57.7 percent of the catch was grouper (serranids) and
                 snapper (lutjanids). Despite the complexity (75
                 documented species and eight fishing methods), this
                 fishery is characterized by the catches of four
                 dominant species: leopard coral grouper (Plectropomus
                 leopardus), orange-spotted-grouper (Epinephelus
                 coioides), spotted coral grouper (P. maculatus), and
                 malabar blood snapper (Lutjanus malabaricus). The
                 species caught varied among fishing methods. Over 90\%
                 of the catch was attributed to three primary fishing
                 methods: bottom longline, speargun, and handline.
                 Multivariate analyses found that fishing depth, season,
                 and/or year significantly influenced the catch
                 composition for each of these fishing methods. Fishing
                 activities exhibit a temporal pattern influenced by
                 monsoonal seasons. Results also suggest that fishers
                 employ specialized fishing tactics by targeting
                 high-value species to maximize their profits. This
                 study recommends a management strategy of focusing on
                 monitoring and managing the three main fishing gears
                 and four important species during their peak seasons to
                 reduce some of the complexity and management costs.",

  abstract =     "The spotted scat (Scatophagus argus) is an important
                 ornamental species with sexually biased ornamental
                 values that favor males. Therefore, it makes sense to
                 breed mono-male fingerlings as ornamental fish. The
                 spotted scat has an XX/XY sex determination system;
                 therefore, the first step in producing genetically
                 all-male offspring should be the induction of a fertile
                 sex-reversed XY pseudo-female, which would then be
                 mated with a normal XY male to produce a YY super-male.
                 However, the XY pseudo-female produced by estradiol (E
                 2) treatment failed due to ovarian malformations. Here,
                 male to female sex reversal was induced in spotted scat
                 through a combination of E 2 and an androgen inhibitor
                 (trilostane, TR). Spotted scat fingerlings of
                 approximately 2.8--3.5 cm were fed a diet containing
                 both E 2 (300 {\SGMLmicro}g/g) and TR (300
                 {\SGMLmicro}g/g). The fish were treated for 90 days and
                 then fed a normal diet until they reached one year of
                 age, when they were sampled. Twenty-eight treated XY
                 individuals were identified using sex-linked markers.
                 According to their gonadal histological
                 characteristics, these treated XY fish could be divided
                 into three groups: males with testes (n = 21), intersex
                 individuals with ovaries--testes (n = 3), and fully
                 sex-reversed individuals with ovaries (n = 4). All
                 treated XX fish (n = 8) developed into normal females.
                 There were no obvious abnormalities in the ovaries of
                 the XY sex-reversed fish compared to the treated XX
                 fish. Serum 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels were
                 significantly lower in XY-reversed females and treated
                 XX females than in XY males. Compared with XY male
                 fish, the expression of female (42sp50, foxl2, figla,
                 zar1, and zp2) and male (dmrt1, gsdf, amh and cyp11b2)
                 biased genes was up- and down-regulated, respectively,
                 in the gonads of XY-completely sex-reversed fish.
                 Immunohistochemical results indicate that 42Sp50 was
                 expressed in oocytes of XY-partially and completely
                 sex-reversed fish, while strong Gsdf signals were
                 mainly detectable in testicular somatic cells of
                 XY-partially sex-reversed fish and XY male fish. XY
                 females were successfully produced by the combined
                 treatment of E 2 and TR in the spotted scat. Their
                 fertility will be tested in the future.",

                 terrestrial ecosystems. The present study examines the
                 effect of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) on the DNA,

                 supplemented with selenium (1 mg/kg diet). The exposure
                 period was 30 days. The results indicated that PS NPs
                 induced oxidative stress by significantly elevating

                 experimental units, each with 30 shrimp with an average
                 weight of 0.2 g. The treatments were control, chicken
                 protein hydrolysate (CPH), enzymatic hydrolysate of
                 chicken feathers, Aquabite {\reg}, CPH + maltodextrin,

                 inclusion level of the different protein sources
                 evaluated was 6\%. At the end of the experiment, all
                 shrimp were counted, weighed, and measured to determine
                 the zootechnical performance. The body and feed

                 There was no statistical difference between the
                 treatments in any of the analyzed parameters. The
                 results showed that all the evaluated protein

  abstract =     "Intensive recirculating systems are a fast-developing
                 sector of aquaculture. While several warm-water fish
                 have been reared in aquaponics, almost no data are
                 available for cold-water species. The determination of
                 nitrate toxicity thresholds in recirculating
                 aquaculture is crucial. Different pollutants are
                 typically more toxic at elevated temperatures. We
                 investigated the performance of Oncorhynchus mykiss
                 under two different nitrate levels and two
                 temperatures. We applied a 2 $ \times $ 2 factorial
                 design, where fish (9.78 {\pm} 0.51 g) were exposed to
                 nitrate concentrations of 40 or 110 mg/L NO 3 {$-$} and
                 to temperatures of 17 {$^\circ $}C or 21 {$^\circ $}C
                 for 20 days. This study focused on understanding the
                 physiological responses of rainbow trout to relatively
                 low nitrate levels under heat stress in order to
                 investigate the feasibility of integrating this species
                 into commercial aquaponics. The growth, condition, and
                 expression of genes involved in metabolism, heat shock,
                 antioxidant, and immune response were assessed in the
                 liver, together with the activities of enzymes related
                 to glucose and fatty acid metabolism. High nitrate
                 levels at 17 {$^\circ $}C affected the condition but
                 did not alter growth, leading to increased glycolytic
                 potential and, occasionally, a greater reliance on
                 lipid oxidation. Antioxidant defense was mainly induced
                 due to high nitrates and the similar expression
                 patterns of antioxidant genes observed under high
                 nitrate at both 17 {$^\circ $}C and 21 {$^\circ $}C.
                 Warm exposure decreased condition and growth, leading
                 to greatly reduced glucokinase transcription,
                 irrespective of the nitrate levels. Exposure to 21
                 {$^\circ $}C and high nitrate led to equivalent growth
                 and condition as well as to a milder inflammatory
                 response combined with metabolic readjustments
                 (enhancement of glycolytic and lipid oxidation
                 pathways) compared to the low nitrates at 21 {$^\circ
                 $}C. Based on the results, rearing at a temperature
                 close to 21 {$^\circ $}C should be avoided for
                 fingerling growth, while NO 3 {$-$} concentration until
                 110 mg/L may not have severe impacts on fingerling
                 health and growth at 17 {$^\circ $}C. In addition,
                 rainbow trout fingerlings can tolerate a 20-day
                 exposure at 21 {$^\circ $}C and NO 3 {$-$} up to 110
                 mg/L. Additional factors should always be considered,
                 such as specific water quality parameters, for a
                 comprehensive approach to assessing the feasibility of
                 rainbow trout aquaculture in aquaponics.",

                 of the gonads was monitored by visual inspection at the
                 termination of the trial. The control group (100r)
                 showed a significantly higher specific growth rate
                 (0.90\% day {$-$1}) compared to the lower fed groups
                 (50r, 0.67\% day {$-$1} and 33r, 0.49\% day {$-$1});
                 however, the growth difference was 21--24\% less than
                 expected solely on the difference in the amount of feed
                 given to each group. The 100r group showed the highest
                 welfare rating, and the 33r group the lowest possible,
                 indicating more aggressive behaviour and fin biting due
                 to feed restriction in the 33r group. No difference (p
                 {$>$} 0.45) was found in the development of maturation
                 in females, but the combined numbers of males in
                 maturity stages 2--5 showed an overall trend towards
                 slower maturation in the 33r group compared to the 100r
                 group. Although the present findings on the development
                 of sexual maturation were subtle due to the limited
                 time frame of the trial, the findings offer a
                 foundation for future investigation into the
                 relationship between the feed ration level and the
                 development of sexual maturation in the rearing of
                 juvenile Atlantic salmon.",

  abstract =     "This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of an
                 integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system
                 comprising co-cultured fed fish and organic extractive
                 species representing three distinct trophic levels as
                 well as the impact and potential utilization of two
                 commercially available fish feeds made up of 35\% fish
                 meal (FM) and 20\% fish meal (LFM) ingredients, using a
                 multi-indicator assessment approach. Significant
                 alterations were observed in growth performance
                 indicators (GPIs), water and sediment quality indices,
                 toxicity tests and biomarkers within the IMTA system.
                 The fish survival, weight gain (WG), and specific
                 growth rate (SGR) were higher in the IMTA system with
                 significantly lower feed conversion ratios (FCRs) and
                 higher feed efficiency (FE) in comparison to the fed
                 fish monoculture system. Yet, organic filter feeders
                 displayed 100\% survival, and increased shell growth,
                 while deposit feeders exhibited successful survival and
                 significant weight gain. In the comparison between
                 FM-IMTA and LFM-IMTA, fed fish in FM-IMTA showed higher
                 WG, SGR, and FE with lower FCR. Environmental
                 parameters like temperature, oxygen, and nutrient
                 concentrations fluctuated but generally improved in the
                 IMTA system, indicating lower mesotrophic conditions.
                 Sediment fatty acid profiles differed between systems
                 and toxicity assessments, which suggested a lower
                 impact in IMTA and FM-IMTA systems. The sediment
                 microbial community displayed high similarity within
                 IMTA systems and between FM-IMTA and LFM-IMTA. These
                 findings underscore the potential of IMTA systems for
                 sustainable aquaculture, emphasizing improved growth
                 performance and reduced environmental impact,

                 pollution in aquatic environments poses a significant
                 threat to the ovarian tissue and reproductive capacity
                 of fish, hindering the development of the aquaculture
                 industry. However, the combined effects of Cu and Cd on
                 fish gonadal development remain unclear. In this study,
                 the fish species Nile tilapia was stressed with rearing
                 water containing 300 {\mu}g/L Cu 2+ and 100 {\mu}g/L Cd
                 2+ for 30 days, followed by an intraperitoneal
                 injection of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
                 (LHRH-{\alpha}) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
                 at various concentrations. We investigated the ovarian
                 transcriptome profiles before and after injection.
                 Prior to injection, combined treatment with Cu and Cd
                 resulted in reproductive dysfunction and metal ion
                 imbalance in tilapia. Transcriptomic profiling revealed
                 differential gene annotation concentrated in the MAPK
                 signaling pathway and regulation of GTPase activity.
                 Post-injection, all concentrations of LHRH-{\alpha} and
                 HCG groups showed an upregulated gonadosomatic index
                 (G.S.I) and higher levels of vitellogenin (VTG),
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadotropin
                 (GTH), and estrogen (E2) in serum compared to the

                 revealed alterations in various ovarian signaling
                 pathways, preliminarily revealing the in vivo molecular
                 mechanisms and differences in LHRH-{\alpha} and HCG.
                 The findings from this study could help us better
                 understand how to counteract the effects of combined Cu
                 and Cd exposure on tilapia ovarian development, which

                 quantifying the spatial distribution of fishing effort
                 is the scientific basis for assessing and managing
                 fisheries resources. The information on the dynamics of
                 fishing vessel voyages provided by the automatic
                 identification system (AIS) of vessels serves as
                 high-precision fishery data and provides a means of
                 quantifying fishing effort with high spatial and
                 temporal resolution in the tuna longline fishery. Based
                 on the AIS data of five tuna longliners operating in
                 the waters near the Marshall Islands from 2020 to 2021,
                 this study used three methods, namely the threshold
                 screening method, the construction of a BP neural
                 network and the support vector machine (SVM) to
                 identify the fishing and non-fishing status of the tuna
                 longliners, respectively. This study investigates the
                 status identification and fishing effort estimation of
                 the tuna longliner (VESSEL A) in 2021 based on the
                 constructed optimal model, and spatial correlation
                 analyses are performed between the fishing effort
                 estimated in hours based on AIS data and in hooks based
                 on fishing logbook data, by month. The results showed
                 (1) the recognition accuracy of the threshold screening
                 method is 89.9\%, the recognition accuracy of the BP
                 neural network classification model is 95.11\%, the
                 kappa coefficient is 0.51, the recognition accuracy of
                 the SVM classification model is 95.74\% and the kappa
                 coefficient is 0.52; (2) in comparison, the SVM
                 classification model performs better than the other two
                 status identification methods for tuna longliners; and
                 (3) the correlation coefficients between the two types
                 of effort of VESSEL A were greater than 0.79 on all
                 fishing months, indicating that there was no
                 significant difference in the spatial and temporal
                 distribution between the two types of effort. This
                 study suggests that the SVM model can be used to
                 identify the status and estimate the fishing effort of
                 longliners.",

                 ecology in the world's oceans is incomplete as they are
                 rarely found in ichthyoplankton samplings or commercial
                 catches and individuals are difficult to observe in the
                 marine ecosystem. Analyses of stomach contents of apex
                 predators can provide otherwise unobtainable ecological
                 insights. Two well-preserved bills of post-larval
                 swordfish were identified among the partially digested
                 stomach contents of an adult male dolphinfish
                 (Coryphaena hippurus) caught in the northern Tyrrhenian

  abstract =     "Selecting the optimal spatiotemporal scale in fishing
                 ground prediction models can maximize prediction
                 accuracy. Current research on spatiotemporal scales
                 shows that they are symmetrically distributed, which
                 may not capture specific oceanographic features
                 conducive to fishing ground formation. Recent studies
                 have shown that deep learning is a promising research
                 direction for addressing spatiotemporal scale issues.
                 In the era of big data, deep learning outperforms
                 traditional methods by more accurately and efficiently
                 mining high-value, nonlinear information. In this
                 study, taking Ommastrephes bartramii in the Northwest
                 Pacific as an example, we used the U-Net model with sea
                 surface temperature (SST) as the input factor and
                 center fishing ground as the output factor. We
                 constructed 80 different combinations of temporal
                 scales and asymmetric spatial scales using data in
                 1998--2020. By comparing the results, we found that the
                 optimal temporal scale for the deep learning fishing
                 ground prediction model is 15 days, and the spatial
                 scale is {0.25$^\circ $} $ \times $ {0.25$^\circ $}.
                 Larger time scales lead to higher model accuracy, and
                 latitude has a greater impact on the model than
                 longitude. It further enriches and refines the criteria
                 for selecting spatiotemporal scales. This result

  abstract =     "The utilization of algae in aquaculture is
                 environmentally friendly, safe, and cost-effective and
                 can effectively substitute for fish meal and fish oil
                 in aquatic feeds. Incorporating algae as dietary
                 supplements leads to significant enhancements in
                 aquatic animals' health and also improves the aquatic
                 ecosystem. Algae are rich sources of nutrients and
                 serve as the foundational food source in the aquatic
                 food chain. Currently, 40 different algae species are
                 employed in aquaculture. Furthermore, algae contributes
                 to elevating the overall quality of aquatic feed
                 products. Aquaculture stands as the most vital food
                 production sector globally; however, challenges such as
                 infection outbreaks and aquatic environmental pollution
                 pose significant threats to the sustainable growth of
                 this industry. An alternative strategy for mitigating
                 environmental issues and improving aquatic production
                 involves the utilization of algae. The novelty in the
                 applications of algae in aquaculture stems from their
                 multifaceted roles and benefits, such as their capacity
                 to improve water quality, serve as nutrient-rich feed
                 supplements, and enhance the overall health and
                 productivity of aquatic species. These versatile
                 applications of algae represent a fresh and innovative
                 approach to sustainable aquaculture practices. This
                 review furnishes insights into the use of algae, algae
                 extracts, or components derived from algae to enhance
                 water quality. Additionally, it covers the utilization
                 of algae-based feed supplements, boosting of the immune
                 system, enhanced growth performance, and disease
                 resistance in aquatic animals.",

  abstract =     "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of
                 high salinity combined with stocking density on
                 Litopenaeus vannamei. Three salinity gradients, namely,
                 28 g/L, 36 g/L, and 44 g/L, and two stocking densities,
                 namely, 300 and 600 shrimp/m 3, were used to analyze
                 the synergistic effect of high salinity and stocking
                 density on the growth performance, digestibility, and
                 energy budgets of L. vannamei. The experimental testing
                 period lasted 45 days. The research results showed that
                 a salinity level of 36 g/L was the most suitable
                 salinity level for shrimp growth under both high and
                 low stocking densities. The body weight, specific
                 growth rate, and relative weight gain of the shrimp in
                 the 36 g/L salinity group were significantly higher
                 than those in the other two salinity groups under both
                 high and low stocking densities. The high-density
                 farming group with 600 shrimp/m 3 exhibited a
                 significant inhibition of shrimp growth compared to the
                 low-density group under the same salinity conditions.
                 The activities of amylase, lipase, and protease in the
                 high-density-group shrimp gradually decreased with an
                 increase in salinity, and the three digestive enzymes
                 had the same overall effect of changing trends. This
                 indicates that under high-density farming conditions,
                 the increase in salinity is not conducive to the
                 digestive function of shrimps. At the same time, the
                 proportion of respiratory energy to feeding energy
                 gradually decreased in the high-density group and with
                 the increase in salinity. However, under the same
                 salinity conditions, the higher the stocking density,
                 the higher the energy consumed by respiration compared
                 to the low-density group. In addition, the expression
                 of the growth-related gene's small nuclear
                 ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G (SNRPG) under high
                 stocking density was significantly lower than that in
                 the low-density group at a salinity of 28 g/L, and
                 ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7) expression was also
                 significantly lower under high stocking density than
                 that in the low-density group at a salinity of 44 g/L.
                 The expression levels of molting-related genes retinoid
                 X receptor (RXR), ecdysone receptor (ECR), and
                 ecdysone-induced protein 75 (E75) were significantly
                 higher in the 36 g/L salinity group compared with the
                 other two salinity groups under high-stocking-density
                 treatment. The findings indicate that the synergistic
                 effects of salinity and stocking density have a
                 significant impact on the growth of L. vannamei, and
                 excessive salinity would inhibit its growth in the
                 process of high-density culturing.",

                 as a result of harsh meteorological conditions (more
                 pressing in the face of climate change) requires a
                 better understanding of this dynamic behaviour through
                 vigilant monitoring and validated numerical models. In
                 this context, data from strain and stress sensors as
                 well as meteorological and current sensors installed at
                 an aquaculture farm in the Region of Murcia (Spain)
                 were collected, processed and analysed. Among them, the
                 first results on the relationship between load and
                 current sensors are presented. Due to the complexity of
                 the time series, various analyses were conducted to
                 examine their interrelation, encompassing the
                 regression analysis of raw data and data segmented into
                 different time intervals. Through this analysis, it was
                 observed that employing distinct time windows better
                 elucidated the data variability. Furthermore, an
                 optimal data window of 240 data points was identified,
                 demonstrating a significantly improved explanatory
                 power, with the coefficient of determination (R 2)
                 increasing by approximately 0.8 depending on the
                 section. This paves the way for optimising the

  abstract =     "Crab aquaculture is an important component of the
                 freshwater aquaculture industry in China, encompassing
                 an expansive farming area of over 6000 km 2 nationwide.
                 Currently, crab farmers rely on manually monitored
                 feeding platforms to count the number and assess the
                 distribution of crabs in the pond. However, this method
                 is inefficient and lacks automation. To address the
                 problem of efficient and rapid detection of crabs via
                 automated systems based on machine vision in
                 low-brightness underwater environments, a two-step
                 color correction and improved dark channel prior
                 underwater image processing approach for crab detection
                 is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of
                 the dark channel prior are optimized with guided
                 filtering and quadtrees to solve the problems of
                 blurred underwater images and artificial lighting.
                 Then, the gray world assumption, the perfect reflection
                 assumption, and a strong channel to compensate for the
                 weak channel are applied to improve the pixels of red
                 and blue channels, correct the color of the defogged
                 image, optimize the visual effect of the image, and
                 enrich the image information. Finally, ShuffleNetV2 is
                 applied to optimize the target detection model to
                 improve the model detection speed and real-time
                 performance. The experimental results show that the
                 proposed method has a detection rate of 90.78\% and an
                 average confidence level of 0.75. Compared with the
                 improved YOLOv5s detection results of the original
                 image, the detection rate of the proposed method is
                 increased by 21.41\%, and the average confidence level
                 is increased by 47.06\%, which meets a good standard.
                 This approach could effectively build an underwater
                 crab distribution map and provide scientific guidance
                 for crab farming.",

                 prey fish in muscle or eggs of second sea-year spawners
                 suggested that 27\% of wild River Simojoki and 68\% of
                 reared River Dal salmon remained in the Gulf of Bothnia
                 in 2014 instead of continuing to the Baltic Proper. In
                 2016, 23\% of the M74 females of the River Simojoki and
                 58\% of the River Dal originated from the Gulf of
                 Bothnia, and 13\% and 16\%, respectively, originated
                 from the Baltic Proper. Some salmon from the River
                 Neris in the southern Baltic Proper had also been
                 feeding in the Gulf of Bothnia. In general, low free
                 thiamine (THIAM) concentration in eggs was associated
                 with high lipid content and high docosahexaenoic acid
                 (DHA, 22:6 {n$-$3}) and {n$-$3} polyunsaturated FA
                 ({n$-$3} PUFA) concentrations in muscle but not in
                 eggs. A higher THIAM concentration and lower
                 proportions of DHA and {n$-$3} PUFAs in Arctic Ocean
                 salmon eggs, despite higher egg lipid content,
                 indicated that their diet contained fewer fatty fish
                 than the Baltic salmon diet. Hence, M74 originated by
                 foraging heavily on young fatty sprat in the Baltic
                 Proper or herring in the Gulf of Bothnia.",

                 the only statistical indicator under the SDG framework
                 which measures the progress to achieve sustainable
                 fisheries. However, despite its advantages, it suffers
                 from substantial limitations. One main problem is that
                 it is ambiguous what this indicator really measures and
                 what the definition of sustainable fisheries is, which
                 is the core concept of SDG Indicator 14.7.1. In
                 particular, this indicator has both an environmental
                 dimension and an economic dimension, but it is unclear
                 how one indicator can exactly reflect these two
                 dimensions at the same time. In addition, while SDG
                 Indicator 14.7.1 emphasizes inclusiveness in name, its
                 definition, methodology, and practical application
                 reveal the exclusion of a substantial number of
                 countries from this indicator. These limitations not
                 only diminish the anticipated functionality of SDG
                 Indicator 14.7.1 but also contradict the objective of
                 inclusivity. Such shortcomings of SDG Indicator 14.7.1
                 are possibly a result of the non-statistical
                 considerations during the development of this
                 indicator, including possible political influence on
                 the statistical scientific process. A number of
                 implications for improving the further development and
                 use of this indicator are provided, such as the
                 provision of more specific data and metadata",

                 were divided into two groups, the G0 group (a control
                 group) and the T0 group (a selenium treatment group on
                 a 0.22 mg/kg diet), for a 6-week feeding time. Then,
                 low-temperature stress (water temperature dropped from
                 26 to 13 {$^\circ $}C, with a rate of 1 {$^\circ $}C/h)
                 was administered after that. The feeding results showed
                 that selenium increased the percent weight gain (PWG),
                 specific growth rate (SGR), and survival rate (SR) of
                 T. fulvidraco and decreased the feed conversion rate
                 (FCR), but these differences were not significant (p

                 no significant effects on antioxidant indexes such as
                 glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, superoxide
                 dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA)
                 content in serum (p {$>$} 0.05). However, metabolomic
                 analysis revealed that selenium caused changes in

                 derivatives, and fatty acyls. Choline, linoleic acid,

                 to produce these metabolites to combat against this

                 of intestinal microbes in T. fulvidraco and decreased

                 environment and its effects on marine animals,
                 especially bony fish. However, the prevalence and
                 effect, particularly concerning biomarkers of oxidative
                 stress, in elasmobranchs remain underreported and

                 two elasmobranch species from the Balearic Islands: the
                 small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) with an
                 average of 4.38 {\pm} 1.77 items per individual, and
                 the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) with an
                 average of 8.31 {\pm} 2.46 items per individual.
                 Moreover, for the first time, antioxidant and
                 pro-inflammatory responses were determined in the
                 digestive tract of individuals of both species.
                 Specifically, the activation of antioxidant defences,
                 mainly superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione
                 levels, was observed, while the pro-inflammatory marker
                 myeloperoxidase activity was also greater in
                 individuals with a high abundance of microplastic
                 items. Additionally, a significant increase in
                 glutathione S-transferase activity in catsharks with
                 high microplastic ingestion was evidenced, suggesting
                 that the detoxification process was activated. Overall,
                 the results of this study highlight that both catshark
                 species are ingesting microplastics, which, in turn,
                 are causing physiological effects at a cellular level.
                 Considering this, continued monitoring of these species
                 should include the presence of microplastics, and the
                 results from this study can serve as baseline data for
                 future research.",

                 aquaculture fish species. To date, in Brazil, there are
                 no reports of V. vulnificus outbreaks in farmed fish.
                 However, in 2019, sorubim (Pseudoplatystoma sp.) in the
                 grow-out phase with clinical signs and cumulative
                 mortality of 40\% was registered. We aimed to identify
                 and characterize the etiological agents of this
                 outbreak. Seven moribund fish were sampled for
                 bacteriological studies, and isolates were obtained

                 using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass

                 isolate, RP4, was used for identification via dnaJ and
                 16S rRNA gene sequencing and antimicrobial
                 susceptibility evaluation. Sorubim juveniles were
                 experimentally challenged with RP4 isolate via
                 intracelomic injection (IC, 10 7 colony-forming units
                 [CFU] fish {$-$1}) and immersion bath (IB, 10 6 CFU mL
                 {$-$1} for 30 min). Identities to V. vulnificus of dnaJ
                 and 16S rRNA genes by BLAST analysis were higher than
                 92\% and 98\%, respectively. Susceptibility to
                 oxytetracycline, florfenicol, and other antimicrobial
                 molecules was also observed. In the IC-challenged
                 group, the mortality rate was 100\% with V. vulnificus
                 recovered from fish organs (brain, liver, spleen, and
                 kidney). Additionally, splenic endothelium alterations
                 were observed in the IC group. On the contrary, the
                 control and IB groups did not develop any clinical
                 signs, mortality, or bacterial recovery after 7 days of
                 challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

  abstract =     "Insect meal has shown promise as a potentially
                 sustainable source of nutrients for aquafeeds, offering
                 an alternative to expensive and ecologically
                 undesirable ingredients, in the context of population
                 explosion and climate change. Despite this promising
                 outlook, its effects on fish growth and immune
                 responses remain to be thoroughly investigated. Our
                 scientific goal was to experimentally test responses to
                 replacements of the fish meal with a protein source
                 derived from black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM).
                 Possible impacts on growth, immunological response, and
                 the expression of selected immune-system related genes
                 were evaluated in Koi carp (Cyprinus carpio var. koi)
                 using a biofloc culture system. Three hundred fish
                 (20.0 {\pm} 0.2 g) were allocated into five groups: a
                 control group receiving a basal diet containing 0 g kg
                 {$-$1} BSFLM and four experimental groups in which fish
                 meal was replaced with 50, 100, 150, and 200 g kg
                 {$-$1} BSFLM for eight weeks. After 4 weeks of feeding,
                 there were no statistically significant differences in
                 specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio
                 (FCR), and survival rate between fish fed
                 BSFLM-enriched diets at 50, 100, 150 g kg {$-$1} and a
                 control (0 g kg {$-$1} BSFLM) diet. However, fish fed
                 200 g kg {$-$1} BSFLM showed significantly improved
                 weight gain (WG) and SGR compared to the control after
                 4 weeks; this difference persisted through 8 weeks (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). After eight weeks, there was a moderate to
                 weak negative linear regression shown in FCR (r =
                 0.470) and SR (r = 0.384), respectively, with the BSFLM
                 levels, but significant and highly correlated linear
                 relationships were observed in WG (r = 0.917) and SGR
                 (r = 0.912). Immunological response analysis showed
                 slight changes in lysozyme and peroxidase levels by
                 replacing fish meal with BSFLM, but these apparent
                 differences were not significantly related to
                 experimental diets. Interestingly, mRNA transcripts of
                 immune-related genes (TNF-{\alpha}, TGF-{\beta}, IL1,
                 IL10, and hsp70) were upregulated in the groups
                 receiving higher amounts of BSFLM, with statistically
                 significant differences observed in certain
                 comparisons. Our findings reveal that fish meal can be
                 effectively replaced by BSFLM, and that this not only
                 has a positive effect on immune-related gene expression
                 in Koi carp, but also on growth rate, pointing to the
                 future potential role of BSFLM as an alternative fish
                 meal protein in aquafeed formulation.",

  abstract =     "The predominant form of aquaculture is the facility
                 fishery, which is also subject to significant impacts
                 from marine disasters. Conducting research on the
                 extraction of facility fishery areas based on remote
                 sensing technology is crucial to efficiently
                 comprehending the configuration of coastal culture
                 patterns and to establishing scientifically sound plans
                 for managing and administering these areas. The
                 extensive dispersion of facility fishery areas in
                 coastal regions poses a challenge to the conduction of
                 comprehensive field surveys. The utilization of
                 satellite remote sensing images for information
                 extraction has emerged as a significant area of
                 research in the fields of coastal fishery and
                 ecological environment. This study provides a
                 systematic description of the current research status
                 of coastal fishery area extraction methods using remote
                 sensing technology from 2000 to 2022 reported in the
                 literature. The methods discussed include the visual
                 interpretation method, image element-based
                 classification, object-based classification, supervised
                 classification, unsupervised classification, and neural
                 network classification. The extraction accuracy of each
                 method in the coastal facility fishery area is
                 evaluated, and the advantages and disadvantages of
                 these methods, as well as their limitations and
                 existing problems, are analyzed in detail, to construct
                 a reference framework for the investigation of the
                 high-precision extraction of facility fishery areas

                 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an active transmembrane
                 transporter that plays a pivotal role in facilitating
                 the movement of both endogenous and xenobiotic
                 substrates (moderately hydrophobic and amphipathic
                 compounds) across cell membranes. P-gp exhibits
                 substrate specificity often shared with other ABC
                 transporters and solute carrier proteins, thereby
                 ensuring the maintenance of chemical homeostasis within
                 cells. These transporters are integral to chemical
                 defense systems in fish, as they actively expel a wide
                 range of substrates, primarily unmodified compounds,
                 from cells. This transport process assists in
                 preventing chemical absorption (e.g., intestine),
                 safeguarding sensitive tissues (e.g., brain and
                 gonads), and effectively excreting substances (e.g.,
                 liver and kidney). Upregulated P-gp export activity in
                 aquatic animals results in the multi-xenobiotic
                 resistance (MXR) phenotype that plays an essential
                 protective role in survival in contaminated
                 environments. Pollutants inhibiting P-gp are termed
                 chemosensitizers and heighten fish sensitivity to toxic
                 P-gp substrates. While the known intrinsic functions of
                 P-gp in fish encompass steroid hormone and bile acid
                 processing, relatively little attention has been given
                 to endogenous substrates and inhibitors. Fish
                 P-glycoprotein regulation is orchestrated by pivotal
                 nuclear transcription factors, including pregnane X
                 receptor (PXR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
                 factor 2 (Nrf2). This comprehensive review provides
                 profound insights into P-gp's significance across
                 diverse fish species, contributing to an enhanced
                 understanding of fish physiology, evolution, and

  abstract =     "Cognitive abilities vary within and among species, and
                 several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
                 variation. Two of the most prominent hypotheses
                 regarding the evolution of cognition link increased
                 social and habitat complexity with advanced cognitive
                 abilities. Several studies have tested predictions
                 derived from these two hypotheses, but these were
                 rarely conducted under natural conditions with wild
                 animals. However, this is of particular importance if
                 we aim to link cognitive abilities with
                 fitness-relevant factors to better understand the
                 evolution of cognition. The biggest hurdle to assessing
                 cognition in the wild is to find a suitable setup that
                 is easy to use under field conditions. Here, we set out
                 to evaluate an extremely simple test of cognitive
                 ability for use with a broad range of aquatic animals
                 in their natural habitat. We did so by developing a
                 detour test paradigm in which fish had to detour a
                 clear obstacle to reach a food reward. By altering the
                 difficulty of the task, we confirmed that this setup is
                 a valid test of cognitive abilities in wild groups of a
                 Lake Tanganyika cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher.
                 Subsequently, we probed specific predictions from the
                 two major hypotheses regarding cognitive evolution
                 using the most difficult test configuration.
                 Specifically, we tested the variation in cognitive
                 abilities among groups of different sizes occupying
                 habitats of varying complexity. We find mixed support
                 for both hypotheses, but we hope that our work inspires
                 future investigations on the evolution of cognition in
                 Lake Tanganyika cichlids.",

  abstract =     "Commercial harvesting of snow crabs (Chionoecetes
                 opilio) began in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, in
                 1967. Today, the fishery consists of 2188 active
                 fishing licenses and has grown into the province's most
                 economically valuable fishery. Snow crabs are captured
                 using conical traps consisting of a mild carbon steel
                 frame, hard plastic entry funnel and a jacket of
                 polyethylene netting. The frames of these traps corrode
                 over time, which is expedited by being deployed in
                 marine environments and stored on land near the ocean
                 when not in use. As a result, there is interest within
                 the community to increase the longevity of crab traps.
                 One solution is to galvanize the steel frames prior to
                 installing the funnel and netting. However, before
                 harvesters transition to galvanized traps, two
                 questions must be answered. Will the use of galvanized
                 steel negatively impact catch rates? Will the life
                 cycle of a crab trap be extended sufficiently to
                 justify the additional cost of galvanizing? This study
                 employed a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate
                 the catch of legal-sized male crabs (CPUE) during the

                 cost (LCC) of traditional and galvanized traps to the

                 inflation (0--6\%) and discount (3--20\%) rates. Our
                 results found no significant difference in CPUE between
                 new traps (traditional vs. galvanized) and concluded
                 that except during instances of very high discount
                 rates (12.9--19.9\%), it is economically favourable to
                 galvanize crab trap frames.",

                 to analyze growth using multiple logistic functions.
                 Three commercially farmed marine species were studied,
                 including shellfish, crustacea, and finfish. The
                 oscillatory version of the von Bertalanffy model as

                 of Rana (Aquarana) catesbeiana. R. catesbeiana
                 tadpoles, in their short larval period, possess a high
                 survival rate and also a highly competitive ability in
                 the amphibious stage. In actual seed production, the
                 economic traits of larval period and metamorphosis rate
                 are used as quantifiable indicators of quality for
                 individuals and populations, respectively. However,
                 studies of these economic traits in larval cultivation
                 and production are still lacking. In this study, we
                 constructed 40 full-sib families of R. catesbeiana and
                 measured the weight and metamorphosis rate of tadpoles
                 at different developmental stages. Subsequently, we
                 calculated the phenotypic and genetic association
                 between weight and metamorphosis rate in tadpoles and
                 assessed the heritability of these two traits. The
                 heritabilities of weight at three developmental stages
                 were all higher than 0.40 and decreased with
                 advancement of the developmental stage; the
                 heritability of the metamorphosis rate was 0.18 {\pm}
                 0.20, a moderate level. Correlation analysis of weight
                 and metamorphosis rate at each developmental stage in
                 each tadpole family showed that weight at stages 25-I,
                 25-II, and 25-III was significantly correlated at the
                 phenotypic level but non-significantly at the genetic
                 level. The metamorphosis rate was only moderately
                 associated with stage 25-III weight (0.38, p {$<$}

                 and transportability of tadpole weight in actual seed

                 measures, yet such impacts have been underreported in
                 the Mediterranean Sea. The silver-cheeked toadfish
                 (Lagocephalus sceleratus) is a toxic pufferfish that
                 since its introduction has seriously disturbed
                 small-scale fisheries along the eastern Mediterranean
                 coast. This species depredates on fishing gears,
                 causing damage to nets, longlines and commercial
                 catches. To quantify its economic impact on small-scale
                 fisheries, we interviewed 141 fishers from Crete
                 (Cretan and Libyan Sea) and the Ionian Sea (Greece)
                 during May 2020--December 2022. The mean annual
                 economic cost resulting from L. sceleratus depredation
                 was estimated at EUR 6315 {\pm} 2620 per vessel in
                 Crete and EUR 258 {\pm} 120 in the Ionian Sea.
                 Additionally, observer surveys carried out on board
                 small-scale fishing vessels in Crete showed that
                 depredation probability was significantly influenced by
                 fishing depth, sea surface temperature, gear type
                 (nets, longlines) and region (Cretan, Libyan Sea). L.
                 sceleratus was caught more frequently and in higher
                 numbers in the Libyan Sea. In response to depredation,
                 fishers in Crete have altered their fishing tactics in
                 terms of fishing in deeper waters, reducing fishing
                 time and changing the technical characteristics of
                 fishing gears. Our results underscore the adverse
                 impacts of L. sceleratus on Greek small-scale fishers,
                 emphasizing the need for region-specific management

                 appended at the end, comprising 1024 units and by a
                 single unit, respectively. To mitigate overfitting
                 concerns, early stopping was implemented. The results
                 revealed that, among the models assessed, the Xception
                 model exhibited the most promising predictive
                 performance. It achieved the highest average accuracy
                 levels of 0.849 and 0.754 during training and
                 validation, surpassing the other models. Furthermore,
                 fine-tuning the Xception model by extending the number
                 of epochs yielded more impressive outcomes. After 30
                 epochs of fine-tuning, the Xception model demonstrated
                 optimal performance, reaching an accuracy of 0.843 and
                 displaying a 11.508\% improvement in predictions
                 compared to the model without fine-tuning. These
                 findings highlight the efficacy of transfer learning,
                 particularly with the Xception model, in accurately
                 distinguishing visually similar aquatic species using
                 smartphone-captured images, even in uncontrolled
                 conditions.",

  abstract =     "Hong Kong oysters (Crassostrea hongkongensis) are an
                 important marine bivalve with nutritional and
                 commercial value. The expanded off-bottom farming scale
                 in recent years makes the oysters more susceptible to
                 exposure to abiotic stresses, such as salinity stress,
                 an important environmental factor that has been proven
                 to have significant effects on oyster growth and
                 development. However, the molecular mechanism is still
                 unclear. Cyclin E is an important protein in the
                 process of cell cycle regulation that is indispensable
                 for propelling G1/S phase transition in a
                 dose-dependent manner. In order to investigate whether
                 the salinity stress affects cyclin E expression in
                 oysters, the cDNA sequence of C. hongkongensis~cyclin E
                 (Ch-CCNE) was isolated from a gill cDNA library, and
                 the 2.8 kbp length cDNA fragment contained a complete
                 open reading frame (ORF) encoding 440 amino acid
                 residues. Ch-CCNE mRNA was highly expressed in the
                 gonad and low in the adductor mussel, mantle, gill,
                 labial palp, and digestive gland. The recombinant CCNE
                 protein was expressed and purified in a pET32a(+)- CCNE
                 / Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) system via IPTG induction
                 and was used for generating mice anti-Ch-CCNE
                 antiserums. Western blot analysis showed that the CCNE
                 protein in the gill was maintained at low expression
                 levels under either hypo- (5 ppt) or hyper- (35 ppt)
                 salinity, and could be produced at high levels under
                 appropriate salinity during a 10-day exposure period.
                 The immuno-localization indicated that the Ch-CCNE
                 protein was distributed in the nucleus. These results
                 suggested that either hypo- or hyper-salinity stress
                 could inhibit the CCNE expression of Hong Kong oysters
                 and their negative impact on cell division and
                 proliferation.",

                 important freshwater fish species in aquaculture.
                 However, as intensive farming has rapidly expanded,
                 infectious diseases caused by various bacteria, such as
                 Aeromonas hydrophila, have also increased. We conducted
                 a transcriptomic analysis of head kidney from P.
                 fulvidraco stimulated by A. hydrophila strain SHOU. A
                 total of 43,249 unigenes with an average length of 1342
                 bp were obtained following assembly and annotation. By
                 analyzing GO and KEGG enrichment, many differentially
                 expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways related to immunity
                 were identified. Out of the 973 DEGs that were
                 identified, 553 were upregulated and 420 were
                 downregulated. Moreover, KEGG enrichment analysis
                 revealed that the innate immune system, including the
                 TNF signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway,
                 and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway involved
                 in the defense, is activated against infectious
                 response. Real-time quantitative reverse
                 transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that
                 immune response genes were upregulated in response to
                 A. hydrophila stimulation compared to the control. In
                 conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into
                 the immune defense mechanism of P. fulvidraco and sheds
                 light on the host immune genes involved in the response

                 represented an emerging threat for the aquatic
                 environment due to their persistence and widespread
                 distribution. Indeed, their small size and increased
                 surface area lead to a high biological reactivity,
                 which can be crucial for the health status of biota. To
                 date, several studies have investigated lethal and
                 sublethal endpoints of MNPs, while one of the main
                 challenges is to understand their mechanisms of
                 toxicity in a comprehensive manner. With this aim, the
                 field of aquatic ecotoxicology can now benefit from the
                 -omics approaches. This review focuses on the recent
                 advances related to the use of transcriptomics,
                 proteomics, and metabolomics to deeply investigate the
                 molecular and biochemical responses of aquatic

                 pristine polystyrene (PS) MNPs. The literature reviewed
                 revealed that transcriptomics and metabolomics are the
                 most frequently used -omic approaches. Overall, the
                 studies taken into consideration shed light on the
                 events triggered by PS MNPs at molecular and cellular
                 levels, identifying as mechanisms of toxicity the
                 pathways involved in oxidative stress, energy
                 metabolism, immune response, and the nervous system.
                 Future studies should therefore focus on the use and
                 integration of multi-omics approaches for a more
                 comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved

                 artificial diets is a new method and developing trend.
                 This method of raising Chinese perch has led to
                 outbreaks of new diseases. In 2022, a disease outbreak
                 occurred among farmed Chinese perch fed an artificial
                 diet in Jiangxi Province, China, during which 50\% of
                 the fish died. The clinical signs exhibited by the
                 diseased Chinese perch included decreased physical
                 vitality, anorexia, emaciation, and dorsal fin
                 ulceration with white cysts and flocs. Coinfection with
                 ciliate parasites and an oomycete was found. No
                 pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the microbial
                 test, and the viral detection results were negative.
                 After morphological and 18S or 28S rDNA sequence
                 clustering analysis, the parasites were identified as
                 Epistylis wuhanensis and Zoothamnium sp., while the
                 oomycete was identified as Achlya klebsiana. This
                 article discusses the interaction between parasitic and
                 oomycete coinfections in Chinese perch from the
                 perspective of the characteristics of Chinese perch
                 raised with an artificial diet. The relationships

  abstract =     "The rabbitfish Siganus oramin is an important
                 naturally caught and aquaculture fish species.
                 Intestinal microbiota can affect the metabolism and
                 immunity of fish, which is closely related to the
                 habitat of the host. In this study, we collected the
                 wild fry S. oramin from a natural sea area, and
                 cultured them in outdoor and indoor ponds,
                 respectively, and investigated the changes in serum
                 biochemical indexes and intestinal microbial community
                 in three different habitats. The results showed that
                 compared with the wild population, the serum total
                 protein content of the outdoor culture population
                 increased significantly. The indoor culture population
                 had significantly higher triglyceride and total
                 cholesterol contents than that of the outdoor culture
                 population. Additionally, the intestinal microbial
                 richness indexes ACE and Chao1 of the cultured
                 population were higher than those of the wild
                 population, especially the indoor culture, but Shannon
                 and Simpson had no obvious changes. The relative
                 abundances of Firmicutes, Spirochaetae and
                 Bacteroidetes increased in the outdoor culture
                 population, but decreased in the indoor culture
                 population; those of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria
                 were completely the opposite. Some putative beneficial
                 bacteria (Lactobacillus, Clostridium sensu stricto 1,
                 and Intestinibacter) and harmful bacteria (Vibrio,
                 Photobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Streptococcus) all
                 decreased in the intestines of the cultured population
                 when compared with the wild population, while
                 Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium were enriched in the
                 outdoor culture population. These results reveal that a
                 change in habitat environment, whether an outdoor or an
                 indoor pond, positively influenced the intestinal
                 microbiota of the rabbitfish, which is beneficial to
                 the healthy culture of the fish from the perspective of

  abstract =     "Environmentally cued hatching is prevalent, diverse,
                 and crucial to many animals' survival. Fish embryos use
                 a variety of chemical cues to initiate hatching to
                 avoid potential predators, yet the function of chemical
                 cues released from the predatory consumption of
                 heterospecific prey is largely unknown. Zebra cichlids
                 (Metriaclima estherae) are ferocious predators that can
                 feed on medaka (Oryzias latipes), though it is
                 impossible for this to occur in their natural habitat.
                 Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos have been employed as
                 experimental subjects due to their sensitivity to a
                 variety of chemical signals. In this study, zebrafish
                 embryos were subjected to three types of chemical
                 signals: predator cues (PCs, released from cichlids),
                 heterospecific cues (HCs, released from medaka), and
                 heterospecific dietary cues (HDCs, released from
                 cichlids that have ingested medaka). As a result, the
                 hatching times of zebrafish embryos were accelerated by
                 6.8\% and 12.6\% by PCs and HDCs, respectively. PCs and
                 HDCs cause significantly reduced morphology in
                 zebrafish embryos, including regarding total length,
                 eye length, dorsal fin length, trunk height, caudal fin
                 height, and body cavity, and increase yolk sac height.
                 The PCs and HDCs diminished the larvae's motion at 120
                 and 144 h post fertilization (hpf), which could be
                 attributed to non-developmental embryogenesis. Overall,
                 the impacts of HDCs on embryonic hatching,
                 developmental morphology, and locomotor were more
                 pronounced in comparison with PCs. Our findings
                 demonstrate that predators' dietary cues, even those
                 released after predation on heterospecific prey, can
                 modify embryogenesis, highlighting the critical
                 functions of chemical signals in predation risk
                 assessment using embryos.",

                 perspective to other Schizothorax species in the
                 region. The study found that S.~eurystomus exhibits
                 positive allometric growth, which is consistent with
                 similar patterns observed in this species from the Syr
                 Darya River basin. The two analyzed condition factors
                 showed mean values within the normal range, indicating
                 good feeding and environmental conditions. However,
                 significant disparities between minimum and maximum
                 values of these factors indicated varied growth
                 conditions which may be influenced by anthropogenic

                 variations in the total length among fish of the same
                 age, and a clear age distribution pattern across
                 different sites. Younger fish predominantly inhabited
                 the shallower, warmer, and lower sections of the river,
                 which is impacted by agricultural water diversion,
                 while older specimens were found in areas with higher

  abstract =     "Elizabethkingia miricola (E. miricola) is a
                 significant pathogen that causes the crooked head
                 disease in black spotted frogs. This disease has
                 plagued numerous frog farms in China and has resulted
                 in substantial losses to the frog farming industry.
                 Nonetheless, the exact mechanism that causes the
                 disease in frogs remains unknown. In this study,
                 transcriptomic and microbiomic analyses were conducted
                 to analyze frog samples infected with E. miricola to
                 reveal the infection mechanism of the pathogen. Liver
                 transcriptomic analysis indicated that the livers of
                 infected frogs had 1469 differentially expressed genes
                 when compared with an uninfected group. These DEGs are
                 mainly involved in immunity and metabolism, including
                 neutrophil extracellular trap formation, the NOD-like
                 receptor signaling pathway, leukocyte transendothelial
                 migration, chemokine signaling pathway, Fc gamma
                 R-mediated phagocytosis, and ``metabolism''-related
                 pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway, carbon
                 metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and
                 glycerolipid metabolism. Similarly, 4737 DEGs were
                 found in the kidney of infected frogs. These DEGs are
                 mainly involved in immunity, including neutrophil
                 extracellular trap formation, the NOD-like receptor
                 signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway,
                 C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, complement
                 and coagulation cascade, and Toll-like receptor
                 signaling pathway. Ten immune-associated DEGs were
                 screened in liver and kidney DEGs, respectively. And it
                 was hypothesized that E. miricola infection could
                 influence the host immune response. Microbiome analysis
                 results showed that some opportunistic pathogens such
                 as Citrobacter, Shigella, and Providencia were
                 significantly elevated (p {$<$} 0.05) in infected
                 frogs. Additionally, functional prediction confirmed
                 that most of the microbiota in infected frogs were
                 linked to metabolism-related KEGG pathways. In this
                 study, the screened genes linked to immunity showed an
                 association with the gut microbiome. The majority of
                 these genes were found to be linked with the abundance
                 of opportunistic pathogens. The results showed that E.
                 miricola infection led to the downregulation of immune
                 and metabolic-related genes, which led to the
                 inhibition of immune function and metabolic disorder,
                 and then increased the abundance of opportunistic
                 pathogens in the gut microbiota. The findings of this
                 study offer a preliminary foundation for comprehending
                 the pathogenic processes of E. miricola infection in
                 black spotted frogs.",

  abstract =     "Coilia nasus is a typical anadromous migratory fish
                 found in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Every
                 year, C. nasus clusters offshore and swims upstream
                 along the Yangtze River into the tributaries and lakes
                 in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to
                 breed. In this study, female C. nasus were collected as
                 study subjects from the Chongming section of Shanghai,
                 the Taizhou section of Jiangsu, and the Anqing section
                 of Anhui. Their ovaries were used to examine tissue
                 sections and investigate gene expression, including the
                 follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (fshr), the
                 luteinizing hormone receptor (lhr), kisspeptin-1
                 (kiss1), and forkhead box l2 (foxl2), which are related
                 to reproductive development, while the serum levels of
                 estrogen (including estradiol, E2) and progestins
                 (including
                 17{\alpha},20{\beta}-dihydroxy-4-pregenen-3-one,
                 17{\alpha},20{\beta}-DHP) were also analyzed. Our
                 results showed that, first, the growth period of the
                 oocytes was small in stage II of ovarian development,
                 in which both E2 and 17{\alpha},20{\beta}-DHP levels
                 and gene expression were low. Then, in stage III, the
                 growth period of the oocytes became large, and the yolk
                 granules and oil droplets began to appear.
                 Simultaneously, E2 and the expression of kiss1 and
                 foxl2 were significantly elevated. Finally, stage IV
                 was the period of a large amount of accumulation of
                 nutrients in the oocytes, and 17{\alpha},20{\beta}-DHP
                 levels and the expression of fshr and lhr were
                 significantly elevated. These results enrich the
                 theoretical study of ovarian development in the natural
                 population of C. nasus, supplementing the biological
                 basis of C. nasus reproduction and scientifically
                 supporting the study of C. nasus population ecology and

                 9 months in six cement tanks (each group with three

                 development of drifting fish eggs, leading to mortality
                 or developmental malformations and ultimately depleting
                 early fish resources. Currently, there is a scarcity of

                 In this paper, the effects of different flow turbulence

  abstract =     "The taxonomy and geographical distributions of
                 Osteobrama species have historically posed challenges
                 to ichthyologists, leading to uncertainties regarding
                 their native ranges. While traditional taxonomy has
                 proven valuable in classification, the utility of an
                 integrated approach is restricted for this particular
                 group due to limitations in combining information from
                 biogeography, morphology, and genetic data. This study
                 addresses the taxonomic puzzle arising from the recent
                 identification of Osteobrama tikarpadaensis in the
                 Mahanadi and Godavari Rivers, casting doubt on the
                 actual distribution and systematics of both O.
                 tikarpadaensis and Osteobrama vigorsii. The research
                 reveals distinctions among specimens resembling O.
                 vigorsii from the Krishna and Godavari riverine
                 systems. Notably, specimens identified as O. vigorsii
                 from the Indian Museum exhibit two pairs of barbels,
                 while those from the Godavari River in this study are
                 identified as O. tikarpadaensis. Inter-species genetic
                 divergence and maximum likelihood phylogeny provide
                 clear delineation between O. vigorsii and O.
                 tikarpadaensis. The study suggests that O. vigorsii may
                 be limited to the Krishna River system in southern
                 India, while O. tikarpadaensis could potentially extend
                 from the Mahanadi River in central India to the
                 Godavari River in southern India. Proposed revision to
                 morphological features for both species, accompanied by
                 revised taxonomic keys, aim to facilitate accurate
                 differentiation among Osteobrama congeners. The data
                 generated by this research provide a resource for
                 future systematic investigations into cyprinids in
                 India and surrounding regions. Further, the genetic
                 diversity information obtained from various riverine
                 systems for Osteobrama species will be instrumental in

                 an important drinking water source for Guangdong and
                 Hong Kong and is responsible for water supplying of
                 more than 40 million people in the Guangdong-Hong
                 Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The study of fish

                 ecological protection, biodiversity, sustainable use
                 and scientific management of fishery resources.
                 However, research on the lake's fish is scarce. The
                 high throughput environmental DNA metabarcoding
                 technology (eDNA technology) of the mitochondrial 12S
                 rRNA gene sequence was herein used to conduct a
                 preliminary exploration of Wanlv Lake fish diversity. A
                 total of 10 sampling sites were set up to monitor fish
                 diversity and analyze the composition and richness of
                 the species. The results revealed a total of 83 genera
                 in 42 families and 17 orders of fish in the lake, with
                 the highest proportion found in Cypriniformes (38
                 species), accounting for 45.24\% of the total. Five
                 alien species and eight rare and endangered species
                 were also detected. The proportion of invasive species
                 was 5.95\%, and the combined proportion of rare and
                 endangered species was 9.52\%. The results indicated
                 that Wanlv Lake serves as an important drinking water
                 source, and overall, the condition of fish is
                 satisfactory. However, proactive measures should be
                 implemented to control the overpopulation of invasive
                 species, as their unchecked proliferation may lead to a
                 decline in species abundance, particularly among
                 endangered species. This was the first overall
                 assessment report on fish of the Wanlv Lake via 12S
                 rRNA; the results herein lay a foundation for water

  abstract =     "This study specifically focused on Litopenaeus
                 vannamei and examined the distribution of residual
                 antibiotics in various components of shrimp ponds
                 throughout an aquaculture cycle. The findings revealed
                 that aquaculture feed served as the primary source of
                 antibiotics, continuously introducing them into the
                 ponds throughout the entire production cycle. A
                 multimedia distribution model for antibiotics in the
                 ponds was established based on the principle of mass
                 balance. The distribution characteristics of six
                 antibiotics with higher levels in the feed, namely,
                 sulfamethoxazole (SMX), norfloxacin (NOF), levofloxacin
                 (LEOF), tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), and
                 chlortetracycline (CTC), were investigated in the pond
                 water, sediment, and shrimp. At the end of the
                 cultivation period, the total antibiotic residues
                 accounted for 65~80\% in various media, with the
                 sediment containing 50~60\% of the distribution
                 proportion (p {$<$} 0.01), which was identified as the
                 primary reservoir for most antibiotics, with LEOF and
                 NOF accounting for the highest proportions (45.78\% and
                 50.29\%, respectively). Based on the model's findings
                 and the allowable daily dosage of antibiotics,
                 recommendations were made for the effective control of
                 antibiotic residues in shrimp farming management. To
                 address the significant net loss of sulfonamides (SAs)
                 and tetracyclines (TCs) in aquaculture production, it
                 is crucial to carefully regulate their dosages and
                 administration methods. Implementing eco-friendly
                 additives and regularly cleaning surface sediments can
                 aid in reducing antibiotic residue levels in various
                 environmental media, thereby mitigating the

                 waters that is economically important for China. It is
                 imperative to understand its distribution
                 characteristics and driving factors. Based on survey
                 data of trawl fishery resources offshore of Zhejiang
                 province, China, in spring (April) and autumn
                 (November) from 2018 to 2022, the spatial and temporal
                 distributions of C. lucidus in this area were analyzed.
                 The random forest (RF) model was used to determine the
                 important marine factors affecting the distribution of
                 C. lucidus. The relationship between the distributions
                 of the important variables was analyzed. The results
                 showed that C. lucidus was mainly distributed in
                 coastal waters. The tail density of the species
                 exhibited obvious seasonal variation and was
                 significantly greater in autumn than in spring. The
                 most important factor affecting the distribution of
                 this species in spring and autumn was water depth. The
                 bottom temperature, bottom salinity and dissolved
                 oxygen concentration were also important influencing
                 factors. The importance of these factors differed among
                 the different seasons, while the chlorophyll a
                 concentration and pH had no significant effect on the
                 species distribution. This study revealed the
                 distribution pattern of C. lucidus in offshore waters
                 of Zhejiang Province and the influence of important
                 marine factors on its distribution. This study can
                 enrich the survey data on C. lucidus and provide basic

                 with five replicates. An exponential equation was
                 adjusted to express the relationship between the
                 stocking density and productivity (postlarvae L

                 postlarval (PL) dry weight did not significantly differ
                 among the treatments (p {$>$} 0.05). When 80 larvae

                 grown, with a spotlight on Asian carp species.
                 Polyculture, i.e. cultivating multiple fish species in
                 a single system, is being increasingly adopted for its
                 resource efficiency and economic benefits. This
                 practice for Asian fish for food and ornamental
                 purposes is gaining traction in Europe despite their
                 invasive potential. Rising temperatures due to climate
                 change offer an opportunity for thermophilic Asian
                 carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Aristichthys
                 nobilis). Using GIS modeling (Maxent), we identified
                 the possible settlement of Asian carp in Northern
                 Europe amidst climate change. We analyzed carp global
                 distribution centers, assessed the potential carp
                 spread in Europe, and evaluated their potential
                 suitability for polyculture systems. By 2050, H.
                 molitrix may extend its range to 58--{62$^\circ $} N
                 latitude, with a potential 1.7-fold habitat increase,
                 while A. nobilis, which are more heat-tolerant, may
                 move north to 52--{58$^\circ $} N latitude, with a
                 1.3-fold potential increase. Despite the slight
                 ecological differences in their native habitats, niche
                 modeling indicates that these carp can occupy similar
                 niches in Europe (proven statistically). The
                 eventuality of using Asian species for polyculture in
                 Europe presents both opportunities and challenges in
                 the face of a changing climate as long as invasion
                 risks are prevented. Envisaging such polyculture, yet
                 very carefully for the protection of ecosystems, can
                 help food security.",

  abstract =     "The diverse freshwater fish fauna of the Japanese
                 archipelago is distributed among four main island
                 landmasses, which include Hokkaido in the north, with
                 many diadromous species. One relatively well-preserved
                 river drainage along the southern coast of Central
                 Hokkaido is the Mukawa River. Fish fauna surveys in the
                 Mukawa River were mostly in downstream areas and the
                 fish diversity is not well-documented among the upper,
                 lower river, and coastal environments. Fish communities
                 in the river, estuary, and sea were sampled using eDNA
                 analysis to evaluate upstream and downstream species
                 detections, and tidal and spatial detection variation
                 near the river mouth. The number of species was higher
                 at the river mouth and nearshore sites compared to the
                 river and offshore. Fish detections reflected life
                 history categories (freshwater resident, diadromous,
                 brackish, or marine) and the environments. Similarity
                 analysis showed that fish species compositions were
                 divided into (1) upstream and midstream, (2) downstream
                 and river mouth, (3) adjacent shore, and (4) offshore.
                 Salmonid, cyprinid, loach, and sculpin species were
                 detected in the river, compared to a mixture of species
                 downstream and along the coast. This rapid assessment
                 type study demonstrated that eDNA survey methodology
                 would be effective for multiple river comparative
                 surveys, seasonality studies, or evaluating possible
                 effects of cross-river weirs or dams.",

  abstract =     "Global marine fish harvests have reached a plateau
                 over the last decade, and efforts to increase
                 aquaculture tend to face limitations in terms of water
                 resources and contamination problems. Of the current
                 fish harvest, at least 50\% is discarded as waste. The
                 current situation requires efforts to process,
                 preserve, and utilize the fish capture to minimize
                 waste. Chemical and microbiological contamination limit
                 the utilization of harvested fish. There is a need to
                 improve fish preservation to minimize spoilage and to
                 process them into more appealing products. Instead of
                 resorting to individual food-processing methods, the
                 efficiency of processing could best be increased by a
                 combination of conventional and modern processing
                 methods or by combinations of modern processing
                 methods. Fish waste is a rich source of oils containing
                 essential fatty acids, polypeptides, and amino
                 polysaccharides that could be utilized through the
                 upscaling of current scientifically proven methods to
                 new processing technologies. The separation of
                 collagens, gelatins, bioactive peptides, edible fish
                 oils, and chitosan form the primary stages in the
                 utilization of fish waste. The products need
                 purification to meet food quality and safety standards
                 and to have desirable industrial characteristics. The
                 diversity of information and products generated through
                 new methods require advanced data handling and
                 prediction systems, such as artificial intelligence, to
                 address food safety and to derive the best out of fish

                 sinensis has great significance in the aquaculture
                 industry. The bacterial communities inhabiting the
                 CMC's gut may differ depending on the host habitat and
                 can aid in their normal biological functioning. These
                 microbes are also known to have certain effects on
                 their flavor. In this study, we utilized MiSeq

                 diversity of bacterial communities in the gut of CMCs
                 from three different geographical locations in Korea:
                 the Geum (GD), Han (HD), and Tamjin (TD) rivers.
                 Although most of the environmental parameters were
                 similar at the three sites, significant differences in
                 conductivity (CDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and salinity
                 were observed. The results show that CMCs sampled from
                 these locations exhibited distinct microbial
                 composition and abundance. For example, the genus
                 Candidatus Hepatoplasma displayed significantly higher
                 abundance in CMCs from HD than those in the other
                 locations, suggesting nutritional stress. Similarly,
                 the crabs collected from TD showed a higher abundance
                 of pathogenic Helicobacter than those from HD and GD
                 sites. We also observed differences in the amino acid,
                 nucleotide, and lactic acid concentrations between
                 different tissues such as the muscle, hepatopancreas,
                 and testis of CMCs. However, only small differences
                 were observed when these characteristics were compared
                 in CMCs from different locations. Our results offer
                 important insights into the intestinal bacterial
                 composition in CMCs which in turn may help in designing

                 parasite-like structures in a popular edible fish, this
                 study aimed to characterize nematode larvae commonly
                 found in the muscle and body cavity of Saurida tumbil
                 (Bloch, 1795) , a commercially important fish species
                 inhabiting the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. This fish,
                 locally known as Hasoom, holds substantial culinary
                 importance, being a staple in the diets of millions
                 residing in countries around the Persian Gulf. A total
                 of 458 Saurida tumbil specimens were obtained from fish
                 markets between June 2022 and May 2023. Subsequent
                 examination revealed the presence of a total of 6132
                 nematode larvae. Nematodes found in the body cavity
                 were identified as belonging to the genus
                 Hysterothylacium sp., family Raphidascarididae, while
                 those in the muscle were identified as Anisakis sp.
                 larval type, family Anisakidae. Histopathology results
                 suggested that these parasites may have adverse health
                 impacts on their fish host. Notably, both nematode
                 genera were found in the third larval stage, which is
                 known to be the infective stage for anisakidosis. Given
                 the reported cases of anisakidosis among people living
                 in the study region, it is strongly recommended that

                 mitochondria during the early life stages of animals
                 can play an important role for an organism's metabolic
                 rate, growth, and health. Previous studies have shown
                 that juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) subjected to
                 elevated temperatures during the embryonic stage
                 respond phenotypically with a reduced metabolic rate.
                 The aim of this study was to explore if embryonic
                 temperature affects the mitochondria content of young
                 brown trout and as such explains the previously found
                 differences in metabolic rates. Here, we optimize a
                 quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for the mitochondria
                 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, and then use the
                 method as a proxy for mitochondrial DNA content. We
                 hypothesize that young trout subjected to elevated
                 temperatures during the embryonic stage respond
                 phenotypically with a reduced mitochondrial DNA
                 content. To test this hypothesis, we subjected brown
                 trout to either control ambient (4.4 {\pm} 1.5 {$^\circ
                 $}C) or elevated temperatures (7.1 {\pm} 0.6 {$^\circ
                 $}C) during embryogenesis. Subsequently, we extracted
                 DNA from liver and white muscle tissue of juvenile
                 brown trout from the two different incubation
                 temperature treatments and successively optimized qPCR
                 for mitochondrial DNA. We found that the amount of
                 mitochondria DNA in liver tissue was 18 times higher
                 than in white muscle tissue, but there was no
                 significant difference in mitochondria content in liver
                 or muscle tissue between brown trout exposed to
                 elevated and ambient control temperatures during
                 embryogenesis. We conclude that reduced metabolic rate
                 is not likely associated with mitochondria DNA content.
                 We also suggest that qPCR is a simple and
                 cost-effective method to quantify mitochondria DNA in
                 frozen and partly degraded tissue from different
                 treatment groups and a useful proxy for identification
                 of differences in mitochondria number.",

                 selected, including crayfish (Procambarus clarkii),
                 freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), pacific
                 white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), black tiger shrimp
                 (Penaeus monodon), kuruma prawns ( Penaeus japonicus),
                 river prawns (Macrobranchium nipponense), and Chinese
                 shrimp (Penaeus chinensis). Their morphometric
                 parameters, nutritional composition, textural
                 properties, and physical and chemical indexes were
                 comparatively analyzed. The results showed that the
                 meat content (MC, about 14.78\%) of crayfish was
                 significantly lower than that of the other six species.
                 By contrast, pacific white shrimp had the highest MC,
                 although the MCs of black tiger shrimp, kuruma prawns,
                 and Chinese shrimp are greater than 40\%. All seven
                 crustacean species were high in protein and low in fat,
                 while pacific white shrimp had the highest crude
                 protein, crude lipid, and crude ash content compared to
                 the other crustaceans. The content of threonine (Thr)
                 was the highest in crayfish. The content of methionine
                 (Met) and lysine (Lys) was the highest in freshwater
                 prawns. The content of isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu),
                 and non--essential amino acid (NEAA) was the highest in
                 pacific white shrimp. C18:2n-6 (linoleic acid, LA) was
                 the highest in freshwater prawns and pacific white
                 shrimp; C18:3n-3 (linolenic acid, LNA), C20:4n-6
                 (arachidonic acid, AA), unsaturated fatty acids (UFA),
                 and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were all the
                 highest in crayfish; and polyunsaturated fatty acids
                 (PUFA) was the highest in freshwater prawns, but the
                 content was not significantly different from crayfish,
                 pacific white shrimp, black tiger shrimp, and Chinese
                 shrimp. Pacific white shrimp had the highest values for
                 hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness. The
                 redness values of crayfish, black tiger shrimp, and
                 Chinese shrimp were significantly higher than those of
                 the other three species except kuruma prawns. Compared
                 to other crustaceans, river prawns had the highest drip
                 loss and cooking loss. Black tiger shrimp and Chinese
                 shrimp had the lowest cooking loss rates. The research
                 shows that the tail muscle of the seven species of
                 crustaceans is rich in protein, essential amino acids,
                 unsaturated fatty acids and low in fat, representing a
                 high-quality protein. Among these crustaceans, the main
                 essential amino acids and essential fatty acids in the
                 tail muscle of pacific white shrimp, freshwater prawns,
                 and crayfish are higher in content and better in
                 nutritional value.",

                 popular tropical freshwater ornamental fish. In 2021,
                 an unknown disease was observed in cultured A.
                 rivulatus in Tianjin, China, with a cumulative
                 mortality rate of 25\% within 7 days of onset. The main
                 clinical signs were scale loss, skin ulceration, and
                 slight bleeding. Histopathological observation revealed
                 obvious damage to the liver, spleen, and kidney of
                 diseased fish. In addition, abundant granulomas were
                 observed in the spleen and head kidney of the diseased
                 fish. To define the potential pathogens from A.
                 rivulatus, bacteria were isolated from the visceral
                 tissue of diseased fish with conventional methods. An

                 elucidated the natural food intake and its contribution
                 to tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) growth in fertilized
                 and unfertilized ponds, using stable isotope and

                 the impact of fertilization management on natural food
                 availability, fish performance, and production costs.
                 Tambaqui juveniles (93.8 {\pm} 15.0 g) were stocked
                 (0.55 fish/m 2) in fertilized (Fert) and unfertilized
                 (NoFert) ponds (600 m 2) for a culture period of 10
                 months in quadruplicate. A lower food conversion ratio
                 was observed in Fert ponds. The main natural food items
                 ingested by tambaqui were insects, vegetables, and
                 cladocerans. Plankton contributed 39.4\% and 10.7\% of
                 muscle formation in Fert and NoFert ponds,
                 respectively. Pond fertilization (2.45 g of nitrogen
                 and 0.80 g of phosphorus per square meter every two
                 weeks) did not significantly affect fish growth,
                 survival, or productivity but had a slightly influence
                 on water quality parameters. However, fertilization
                 increased the zooplankton density (through
                 phytoplankton) in the water, thereby increasing
                 autochthonous food availability for tambaqui
                 consumption. This species demonstrates the ability to
                 alternate between natural food sources and commercial
                 feed without compromising its development.
                 Consequently, tambaqui exhibits suitability for farming
                 within restorative and integrated aquaculture systems

                 intestinal digestive capacity, and microbial
                 composition of the hindgut of Furong crucian carp. The
                 feeds were formulated to contain 0\%, 6\%, 12\%, 18\%,

                 five diets (crude protein: 33\%; crude lipid: 5\%). The
                 results showed that incorporating 6\% fermented soybean

                 weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR)
                 and decreased the feed coefficient rate (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 Through regression analysis of WGR and SGR, the optimal
                 levels of the dietary fermented soybean residue of
                 Furong crucian carp were determined to be 6.78\% and

                 intestinal amylase activity, and intestinal villous
                 height of Furong crucian carp (p {$<$} 0.05). At the
                 6\% level, fermented soybean residue significantly
                 increased the abundance of Romboutsia and

                 (e.g., mangroves, seagrass beds, and macroalgal beds)

                 less than 900 g in weight, increased fishing effort
                 focusing on this size class has led to a drastic

                 (formation of oocytes and other reproductive tissues)
                 to identify reproductive processes and evaluate the

                 The presence of postovulatory follicles (POFs) peaked
                 in April, which was interpreted as a period of intense
                 spawning. In addition to POFs, hydrated oocytes peaked
                 in July, indicating either reproductive continuity or a
                 second peak, based on the presence of atretic oocytes
                 and atresia. Given that the local snapper fishery

  abstract =     "Ascidian biofouling generates significant challenges
                 to bivalve aquaculture. Their rapid spread across
                 almost every available surface leads to increased
                 maintenance costs and reduced yields in shellfish
                 farming. In addition, ascidians may introduce pathogens
                 or toxins, further compromising the health and
                 marketability of bivalve stocks and thereby
                 necessitating strict management strategies to manage
                 these impacts. The aim of this study was the evaluation
                 of different management practices for eliminating
                 ascidian fouling and the identification of the best
                 method for Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819)
                 aquaculture farms. The effects of different
                 anti-fouling treatments as well as their interactive
                 outcomes were examined by conducting two experiments.
                 Various experimental procedures were applied, including
                 the temporally differential washing of mussels, air
                 exposure and immersion in 50 ppt and 70 ppt salinity
                 solutions, as well as the combination of these
                 applications. All treatments reduced the number of
                 ascidian colonies on mussel socks but at varying
                 proportions. Immersing mussel socks in a 70 ppt
                 salinity solution followed by air exposure for 1 day
                 was the most efficient method and led to a 93\%

                 meal and more of the readily available and cheaper
                 plant proteins. To counteract the lower attractiveness
                 and palatability of plant proteins, feeds are
                 supplemented with ingredients known to have
                 chemoattractive properties that will increase feed
                 intake. This study investigated the putative
                 chemoattractive effect of Calanus finmarchicus
                 hydrolysate, when used as a dietary supplement in
                 shrimp feeds. C. finmarchicus is a zooplankton species
                 native to the northern Atlantic Ocean and is a novel
                 and sustainable raw material for shrimp feed products.
                 Diet attractiveness was evaluated in a 24-day feeding
                 trial with whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) by
                 measuring the intake of 12 diets with various levels of
                 fish meal, calanus hydrolysate, and krill (Euphausia

                 ingredients resulted in increased feed intake, and
                 supplementing the high fish meal diet with calanus
                 hydrolysate gave a statistically significant higher
                 feed intake. Low molecular weight peptides,
                 chemoattractive amino acids, and the water-soluble
                 nature of the hydrolysate could explain the

  abstract =     "The accurate labeling of species and size of specimens
                 plays a pivotal role in fish auctions conducted at
                 fishing ports. These labels, among other relevant
                 information, serve as determinants of the objectivity
                 of the auction preparation process, underscoring the
                 indispensable nature of a reliable labeling system.
                 Historically, this task has relied on manual processes,
                 rendering it vulnerable to subjective interpretations
                 by the involved personnel, therefore compromising the
                 value of the merchandise. Consequently, the
                 digitization and implementation of an automated
                 labeling system are proposed as a viable solution to
                 this ongoing challenge. This study presents an
                 automatic system for labeling species and size,
                 leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
                 Specifically, the performance of VGG16,
                 EfficientNetV2L, Xception, and ResNet152V2 networks is
                 thoroughly examined, incorporating data augmentation
                 techniques and fine-tuning strategies. The experimental
                 findings demonstrate that for species classification,
                 the EfficientNetV2L network excels as the most
                 proficient model, achieving an average F-Score of 0.932
                 in its automatic mode and an average F-Score of 0.976
                 in its semi-automatic mode. Concerning size
                 classification, a semi-automatic model is introduced,
                 where the Xception network emerges as the superior
                 model, achieving an average F-Score of 0.949.",

                 common Chinese mitten crab varieties, ``Jianghai 21''
                 and ``Changjiang 2'', cultured in Jiangxi Province.
                 Over the breeding period, parameters such as body
                 weight, height, carapace length and width, and lengths
                 of the second and third legs exhibited increases.
                 Growth indices of ``Jianghai 21'' surpassed those of
                 ``Changjiang 2'' during the intermediate and late
                 breeding phases. While ``Changjiang 2'' demonstrated
                 significantly higher crude lipid content than
                 ``Jianghai 21'', the latter exhibited markedly higher
                 levels of total amino acids (TAAs), essential amino
                 acids (EAAs), and delectable amino acids. Although
                 overall nutrient composition did not significantly
                 differ, TAA and EAA contents in the hepatopancreas were
                 notably greater in ``Jianghai 21'' than in ``Changjiang
                 2''. Moreover, a total of 901 differentially expressed
                 genes (DEGs) were identified between the two varieties,
                 with 560 upregulated and 341 downregulated. These DEGs
                 were primarily associated with pathways related to
                 fatty acid degradation, metabolism, and growth
                 regulation. The observed variances in growth
                 performance and nutrient composition between ``Jianghai
                 21'' and ``Changjiang 2'' suggest potential regulation
                 by relevant genes. In summary, the results showed that
                 the growth performance of ``Jianghai 21'' is greater
                 than that of ``Changjiang 2'', offering valuable
                 insights for the selection of aquaculture varieties in

                 ubiquitous disease that affects the aquaculture
                 industry and causes the mass mortality of turbot.
                 Vibrio vulnificus is a pathogen that causes skin ulcers

                 significant mortality in aquaculture. In this study, we
                 have established a bivalent inactivated vaccine against
                 A. salmonicida and V. vulnificus with
                 Montanide{\trademark} ISA 763 AVG as an adjuvant. This
                 bivalent inactivated vaccine was used to immunize
                 turbot by intraperitoneal injection, and the relevant
                 immune indexes were detected. The results demonstrate

                 significant increase in serum antibody levels in
                 immunized turbot, which was positively correlated with
                 immunity. In the kidney tissue, related immune genes (

                 significantly, showing that the vaccine can induce
                 cellular and humoral immune responses in turbot. In
                 conclusion, the bivalent inactivated vaccine against A.
                 salmonicida and V. vulnificus was immunogenic,
                 efficiently preventing turbot from infection, which has

                 which allows for predicting their length at first
                 maturity. Thus, mean lengths at first maturity (L m)
                 and the corresponding maximum lengths (L max) in 207
                 populations of 131 species of coral reef fish were

                 size-related parameter acting as a trigger for their
                 maturation and eventual spawning, and (b) that this
                 single value is statistically the same as that
                 published previously for other bony fish. The results,
                 based on the assembled L m and L max data and on
                 estimates of the parameter D, which link the length of

                 given ocean warming and deoxygenation, coral reef fish
                 will not only be smaller than they currently are, but
                 also mature and spawn at smaller sizes, and thus

                 hydrophila. The fish were fed with VC levels ranging
                 from 25.35 to 2231.98 mg/kg for 60 days. After that,
                 fish fed with 150.65 mg/kg, 573.79 mg/kg, and 2231.98
                 mg/kg VC were challenged with A. hydrophila orally to
                 simulate enteritis. The results showed that 285.39 and
                 573.79 mg/kg dietary VC significant improved growth
                 performance and feed utilization. Dietary VC (573.79
                 and 1133.79 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the serum
                 immune parameters, antioxidant enzymes' activities, and
                 relative gene expressions of ikb{\alpha} and cat in the
                 liver in the 60-day feeding trail. The survival rate
                 was significantly higher in 573.79 mg/kg dietary VC
                 group than the other two treatments. Cytokines were
                 activated after the bacteria challenge. Dietary 573.79
                 mg/kg VC caused significantly higher TNF-{\alpha} level
                 at 12 hpi and maintained a high level of IL-8 at 48 to
                 72 h compared to other treatments. In conclusion, more
                 than 500 mg/kg VC was needed to maintain the health of
                 blunt snout bream juveniles. Suitable VC would activate
                 cytokines to increase disease resistance along with
                 antioxidant enzymes.",

                 (km 169--197). The sampling collection started with the
                 first signs of Pontic shad migration, on 4 March 2023,
                 and continued weekly until the beginning of June 2023,

                 substitute for fishmeal (FM) in juvenile hybrid culter
                 (Erythroculter ilishaeformis {[female-sign]} $ \times $
                 ~ Ancherythroculter nigrocauda {[male-sign]}). A total
                 of 360 fish with an initial body weight of 10.0 {\pm}
                 0.5 g were randomly allocated into 12 indoor culture
                 tanks, with each tank containing 30 fish. Four diets
                 were formulated in which fish meal (FM) was replaced by
                 CPC at different inclusion levels: 0\% (T0), 15\%
                 (T15), 30\% (T30), and 45\% (T45). The corresponding
                 amounts of CPC included were 0, 61, 122, and 182 g/kg,
                 respectively. At the end of the 10-week feeding trial,
                 the findings revealed an inverse correlation between
                 the proportion of CPC replacing FM and both final body
                 weight (FBW) and weight growth rate (WG) in hybrid
                 culter. Specifically, the T30 and T45 groups exhibited
                 significantly lower FBW and WG compared to the T0 group
                 (p {$<$} 0.05). No significant differences in crude
                 protein and ash contents were observed among all groups
                 (p {$>$} 0.05). However, the crude lipid content was
                 highest in hybrid culter fed the T45 diet and lowest in
                 the T0 group (p {$<$} 0.05). There were no significant
                 differences in muscle amino acid composition among all
                 treatment groups (p {$>$} 0.05). The contents of total
                 protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) declined slightly as the
                 proportion of FM substituted by CPC increased, yet this
                 decline did not reach statistical significance (p {$>$}
                 0.05). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity
                 elevated with increasing dietary CPC, and the T45 group
                 exhibited significantly higher ALT activity compared to
                 the T0 group (p {$<$} 0.05). The hepatic activities of
                 superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were
                 significantly lower in the T45 group than in the T0 and
                 T15 groups (p {$<$} 0.05). Furthermore, there was a
                 decrease in intestinal villi length with an increasing
                 replacement ratio of FM by CPC, and the villi length in
                 the T45 group exhibited a significant reduction when
                 compared to that in the T0 group (p {$<$} 0.05). It is
                 concluded that replacing 15\% FM with CPC does not
                 exert obviously detrimental effects on growth
                 performance, serum biochemical indices, intestinal

                 aquaculture, is growing all the time. The intensive
                 method, which is the most common method in shrimp
                 aquaculture, remains commercially challenged due to the
                 expenditures associated with environmental pollution
                 abatement. Although the comprehensive understanding of
                 this intricate aquaculture environment has been
                 advanced using mathematical modeling, recent attempts
                 to improve the model's structure have not yielded
                 enough results. This work upgraded the previous method
                 to a three-dimensional hydrodynamic ecosystem model
                 with the effects of shrimps being replaced by
                 approximation equations for the environmental

                 development, and inter-annual variability can affect
                 the ecology of estuarine fish and invertebrates.
                 Yaquina Bay, Oregon, a well-studied estuary, has
                 undergone intense development, as well as deep-draft
                 dredging during the latter half of the 20th century,
                 resulting in the alteration of ~45\% of the lower
                 estuary's natural shoreline. In 1967, the United States
                 Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) conducted a
                 21-month survey of Yaquina Bay to characterize the
                 demersal fishes and epibenthic crustaceans that occupy
                 the bay. From 2003 to 2005, we conducted a 25-month
                 survey to replicate that work and provide a comparative
                 snapshot of the demersal fish and epibenthic crustacean
                 community in the bay. A comparison of the trawl survey
                 datasets reveals a 91\% decline in total catch per unit
                 effort (CPUE) between surveys, as well as a decline in
                 multiple measures of biodiversity. Furthermore, the
                 fishes and crustaceans of Yaquina Bay have experienced
                 a shift in species dominance from demersal fishes in
                 the late 1960s to epibenthic crustaceans in the 2000s,
                 marked most notably by a nine-fold increase in the
                 Dungeness crab CPUE. While this work does not establish
                 a causal relationship between changes in the demersal
                 communities of this West Coast estuary and human or
                 natural events, it does document substantial changes in
                 both the diversity and total abundance of animals in
                 that community over a three-plus decade period of
                 development and environmental variability. Hence, this

                 pelagic fish with commercial and ecological importance.
                 In spite of its importance, in recent years, specific
                 research on anchovy in the Shandong Peninsula area has
                 been relatively scarce and outdated. This study aims to
                 estimate the age and growth characteristics of anchovy
                 through year-round seasonal sampling from 2016 to 2017,
                 utilizing length--frequency and otolith microstructure
                 analysis. The higher coastal abundance and larger size
                 observed in the spring and summer suggest a potential
                 peak spawning period for anchovies dominated by
                 larger-sized individuals. Based on otolith analysis,
                 anchovies range in age from 0 to 4 years, with a
                 limited presence at age 0 and dominance in the age-1
                 group. The length--weight relationship (LWR) equation
                 shows hyper-allometric growth for each season, with a
                 mean relative condition factor (K n) of 1.025 {\pm}
                 0.005, indicating good health. Additionally, the von

                 suggesting a medium growth rate (K = 0.604). These
                 findings contribute to the understanding of anchovy age
                 and growth patterns, emphasizing the continuous need
                 for research and monitoring to support rational and

                 bungeanum) seed kernel oil (PASO) on the lipid
                 metabolism of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus)
                 under a high-fat diet, PASO were added into two
                 lipid-level (4 g/kg and 8 g/kg) diets to form four
                 isonitrogenous diets: soybean oil (SO), PASO, high-fat
                 soybean oil (HSO), and high-fat prickly ash seed oil
                 (HPASO). A total of 216 healthy grass carp (9.43 {\pm}
                 0.82 g) were randomly divided into four groups and fed
                 with the four diets, respectively, for 56 days. The
                 result showed that the viscerosomatic index (VSI) and
                 the content of the crude lipid in the hepatopancreas
                 and muscle was significantly higher by oil levels (p
                 {$<$} 0.05). The linolenic acid content in the body of
                 the fish significantly increased in PASO and HPASO
                 compared to that in SO and HSO (p {$<$} 0.05). The
                 fatty acid composition of the hepatopancreas,
                 intraperitoneal fat, and muscle in four dietary groups
                 was significantly similar to the fatty acid composition
                 in the diets (p {$<$} 0.05). More significant fat
                 infiltration and nuclear translocation in the
                 hepatopancreas of fish was found in the HSO group but
                 was decreased in the HPASO group. The adipocyte size in
                 the intraperitoneal fat tissue in the PASO group was
                 significantly lower than that in the SO group (p {$<$}
                 0.05). The relative mRNA expression of the
                 lipogenesis-related genes ppar-{\gamma}, cebp -
                 {\alpha}, and srebp-1c was significantly down-regulated
                 in the PASO group compared with the SO group (p {$<$}
                 0.05), and the mRNA expression of lipolysis-related
                 genes ppar-{\alpha} and cpt-1 were significantly
                 up-regulated in the PASO group (p {$<$} 0.05). In
                 conclusion, dietary PASO showed the function of
                 reducing lipid accumulation in the fish. This reduction
                 might be attributed to the inhibition of the
                 lipogenesis-related genes and the stimulation of the
                 lipolysis-related genes, which were probably modulated
                 by the high content of linolenic acid in PASO.",

  abstract =     "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play central roles
                 in the growth and development of vertebrates. Blotched
                 snakehead (Channa maculata), an economically
                 significant fish, exhibits obvious sexual dimorphism
                 and achieves sexual maturity in one year. However, the
                 role of IGFs in C. maculata remains unknown. Three IGF
                 genes were identified in C. maculata, designated as
                 CmIGF1-1, CmIGF1-2, and CmIGF2. The cDNA sequences of
                 these genes are 1184, 655, and 695 bp, encoding
                 putative proteins of 168, 131, and 215 amino acids,
                 respectively, and all three proteins contain a
                 conserved IGF domain. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
                 revealed the predominant expression of CmIGFs in the
                 liver of adult fish, with higher expression levels
                 observed in males. Notably, CmIGF1-1, CmIGF1-2, and
                 CmIGF2 displayed analogous expression profiles in the
                 liver across various developmental stages, peaking at
                 365 days after hatching (dah). Subsequently, 600
                 individuals at 75 dah, at an early developmental stage,
                 were randomly divided equally into six groups and
                 reared in aerated 2 m $ \times $ 2 m $ \times $ 2 m
                 cement ponds at 26.0 {\pm} 1.0 {$^\circ $}C. Following
                 a one-week acclimatization period, fish without
                 observed abnormalities were intraperitoneally injected
                 with either 17{\alpha}-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) or
                 17{\alpha}-methyltestosterone (MT) at a dose of 10
                 {\mu}g/g body weight. Three groups underwent short-term
                 hormone treatment, and the remaining three groups
                 underwent long-term hormone treatment, which included
                 five injections at two-week intervals over ten weeks.
                 The analysis of CmIGFs expression levels in the liver
                 under different hormone treatments revealed that EE 2
                 suppressed the expression of CmIGF1-1 and CmIGF1-2
                 while promoting CmIGF2 expression. In females, MT
                 up-regulated the expression of CmIGF1-1 and CmIGF2 in a
                 time-dependent manner, but consistently inhibited
                 CmIGF2 expression. In males, MT promoted the expression
                 of CmIGFs in a time-dependent manner, reaching peak
                 levels for CmIGF1-1, CmIGF1-2, and CmIGF2 after 8, 10,
                 and 2 weeks of injection, respectively. Additionally,
                 CmIGF1 and CmIGF2 might exhibit a complementary
                 relationship, with a compensatory increase in CmIGF2
                 expression in response to low CmIGF1 concentration.
                 These findings highlight the potential key role of IGFs
                 upon growth and their regulation by sex steroid
                 hormones in C. maculata, providing a crucial foundation
                 for future research aimed at elucidating the molecular
                 mechanisms underlying the growth dimorphism between
                 female and male blotched snakeheads.",

                 vocal characteristics of YFPs in different behavioral
                 states and their differential performance, we recorded
                 the vocal activities of YFPs in captivity during
                 free-swimming, feeding, and nighttime resting and
                 quantified their signal characteristic parameters for
                 statistical analysis and comparison. The results showed
                 that the number of vocalizations of the YFPs in the
                 daytime free-swimming state was lower than that in the
                 feeding and nighttime resting states, and the
                 echolocation signals emitted in these three states
                 showed significant differences in the {$-$10} dB

                 using the ambiguity function indicated that their
                 distance resolution could reach the millimeter level.
                 These results indicate that the echolocation signal

                 and pyknosis, and myocardial fiber fracture and
                 atrophy. RV-JZ01 infection significantly reduced the
                 gut flora diversity of R. ventralis, with the relative
                 abundances of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria increasing,
                 and those of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes
                 decreasing. The abundance of Lactobacillus and
                 Streptococcus dramatically increased, and the abundance
                 of Clostridium and Escherichia reduced in the
                 intestinal microbiota of R. ventralis infected with
                 RV-JZ01. Antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed that
                 RV-JZ01 was highly susceptible to 12 antimicrobials,
                 including erythromycin, cefalexin, norfloxacin,
                 furazolidone, sulfonamides, enrofloxacin, doxycycline,
                 piperacillin, florfenicol, gentamicin, and lincomycin.
                 These results contribute to the understanding of
                 pathological alterations in R. ventralis following A.

                 the implementation of disease treatment.",

  abstract =     "Snow crab replaced groundfish fisheries as the primary
                 focus of the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) fishing
                 industry in the mid-1990s. Over the past three decades,
                 management philosophies in this male-only fishery have
                 shifted from promoting industry expansion to promoting
                 industry rationalization to implementing Precautionary
                 Approach (PA) management. Until the mid-2010s, there
                 were regionalized management strategies characterized
                 by higher exploitation rates in northern than southern
                 sub-stock units along the NL marine shelves. However,
                 in the late 2010s, exploitation rates were permitted to
                 elevate to high levels across the entire stock range in
                 association with a large resource decline, and evidence
                 of biological harm through fishing emerged in
                 chronically depleted areas. In 2019, when stock and
                 fishery productivity were near historical lows, a
                 multi-indicator PA system was informally introduced
                 into the management of the resource. This event
                 coincided with anticipated improvements in stock and
                 fishery performance. This paper examines the extent to
                 which the multi-indicator PA management system, focused
                 on the promotion of both biological protection and
                 maximization of fishing efficiency, may have
                 contributed to recent improvements in stock and fishery
                 status. A suite of indicators from areas implementing
                 PA guidance into management in 2019 prior to the formal
                 adoption of the PA system in 2023 suggest the system
                 has been highly beneficial in promoting rapid recovery
                 and improving stock and fishery performance metrics to
                 levels matching or exceeding historical levels under
                 similar conditions. We discuss the capacity of the
                 system to better safeguard biological aspects of
                 resource and fisheries productivity moving forward
                 under a scenario of an expectant resource decline.",

                 present work aims to record the occurrence of
                 freshwater stingrays in the Uatum{\~a} river basin,
                 Amazonas, Brazil. For this, collections were carried
                 out in three municipalities bathed by the Uatum{\~a}
                 River, Presidente Figueiredo, Itapiranga, and S{\~a}o

                 through fishing using a hand net and, after capture,
                 were identified through the pattern of the dorsal and
                 ventral color of the disc, the absence or presence of
                 the labial groove, and the organization of the row of
                 spines on the tail, and were also measured, weighed,
                 and sexed. In total, 69 specimens of Potamotrygonines
                 were captured, 59 of which were from the genus
                 Potamotrygon and ten individuals from the genus
                 Paratrygon. The present study provides preliminary

                 phosphorescent-netting pots to snow crab (Chionoecetes
                 opilio) using visual modeling techniques. Light emitted
                 from such pots increases catch per unit effort, yet
                 little is understood about the factors driving these
                 higher catch rates. In this study, we measure pot light
                 emission and snow crab visual acuity. Combining these
                 data with estimates obtained in the literature for
                 other biotic and abiotic factors, we model snow crab
                 vision in relation to the pots. Utilizing these factors
                 and environmental conditions, we derive a contrast
                 ratio between the pot light and the ambient light.
                 Findings reveal that the visibility of pot lights at
                 200-m depth depends primarily on solar angle (time of
                 day) and time elapsed post-deployment. Additional

                 water column quality and benthic boundary layer

                 pelagic migratory fish with potential for aquaculture.
                 Despite this, there is limited understanding of the
                 biological and physiological characteristics of this
                 species, particularly regarding sex differences in
                 growth performance. The liver, a crucial organ for
                 digestion and metabolism, plays a significant role in
                 regulating fish growth. This study aimed to compare
                 liver enzyme activities and transcriptome profiles
                 between female and male yellowfin tuna to uncover the
                 molecular mechanisms underlying difference between the
                 sexes. The results revealed that female yellowfin tuna
                 exhibited higher amylase and lipid metabolism enzyme
                 activities, while male yellowfin tuna showed higher
                 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and antioxidant
                 enzyme activities. Additionally, through Illumina
                 sequencing technology, the study generated 37.74 Gb of
                 clean data and identified 36,482 unique genes

                 differentially expressed genes were found, with

                 metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism and
                 transport. These findings suggest that female yellowfin
                 tuna have superior digestive enzyme activities and
                 lipid metabolism, while male yellowfin tuna excel in
                 sugar metabolism, ATP production, and antioxidant
                 defense. This study provides valuable insights into sex
                 differences in yellowfin tuna and could aid in

                 muscle. MaCalm showed significant upregulation at 14 d
                 and 28 d post exposure to varying concentrations of
                 cadmium in the liver; HSP70 transcripts in the liver
                 significantly upregulated at 14 d post exposure to
                 different concentrations of cadmium. Moreover, in
                 response to the A. hydrophila challenge in vivo, MaCalm
                 transcripts in the liver first increased and then
                 decreased, but MaCalm transcripts in the kidney
                 declined gradually with prolonged infection. After the
                 A. hydrophila challenge, the expression level of HSP70
                 was significantly downregulated at 24 h in the liver
                 and its expression level was notably downregulated at
                 12 h and at 24 h in the kidney. Collectively, our
                 results suggest that MaCalm possesses vital roles in
                 stress and immune response in M. amblycephala.",

                 12-week trial, five isonitrogenous and isolipidic feeds
                 contained different C. butyricum levels [G1 (0), G2

  abstract =     "The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) is one of
                 the most commercially important crustacean species in
                 China. The aim of this study was to characterize the
                 toxic effects of butachlor (an herbicide of the
                 acetanilide class) on juvenile E. sinensis crabs. The
                 lethal effects and the acute toxicity of butachlor on
                 juvenile E. sinensis specimens were assessed through a
                 semi-static in vitro experiment. We determined the
                 activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
                 (CAT) as well as the levels of glutathione (GSH) and
                 malondialdehyde (MDA) in the gills and the
                 hepatopancreas of the juvenile crabs, at different time
                 points over a 14-day short-term exposure to butachlor.
                 Moreover, we measured the residual levels of butachlor
                 in three different tissues (gills, hepatopancreas, and
                 muscles) of the juvenile crabs over a longer period.
                 Our findings revealed that butachlor is highly toxic
                 for juvenile E. sinensis crabs. In fact, the median
                 lethal concentration (LC 50) values of butachlor at 24,
                 48, 72, and 96 h were found to be 4.22, 1.84, 0.34, and
                 0.14 mg/L, respectively, while the safe concentration
                 was 0.014 mg/L. The antioxidant defense ability of the
                 juvenile E. sinensis crabs against butachlor was
                 induced after exposure to the herbicide at a
                 concentration of 0.01 mg/L. After 14 days of exposure
                 to butachlor at 0.04 and 0.16 mg/L, both SOD and CAT
                 were found to be significantly inhibited (p {$<$}
                 0.05), the GSH levels were found to be significantly
                 decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) and the MDA levels were
                 identified as significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.05).
                 Moreover, after 14 days of exposure to butachlor at
                 0.16 mg/L, the activities of SOD and CAT as well as the
                 content of GSH in the hepatopancreas were found to be
                 significantly decreased (p {$<$} 0.05). Our results
                 revealed that a high concentration of butachlor was
                 capable of inducing oxidative stress and damage in
                 juvenile E. sinensis crabs. The maximal residual value
                 of butachlor was obtained in the gills, with a content
                 of 4.56 {\mu}g/kg. Butachlor was not detected after 24
                 days in the aforementioned three tissues of the
                 juvenile crabs, thereby indicating that it was
                 effectively metabolized.",

                 antioxidants, non-specific immune response, growth
                 performance, and microbial diversity. The experimental
                 design of this study consisted of two groups with three
                 replicates for each, i.e., control group: aquatic
                 monoculture (AM) system with only P. vannamei;
                 treatment group: P. vannamei - I. aquatica raft
                 aquaponics (AP) system with a 50\% cover ratio with a
                 water spinach floating raft. The experiment lasted for
                 seven weeks. The results show that the concentrations
                 of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate
                 nitrogen (NO 3 {$-$} -N), ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 + -N),
                 nitrite nitrogen (NO 2 {$-$} -N), and active phosphorus
                 (AP) in the AM group were higher than those in the AP
                 group at different sampling times. The water quality
                 index of the AP group was better than that of the AM
                 group, indicating that water spinach can remove the
                 nutrients from aquaculture water bodies. The average
                 daily gain and survival rate of shrimp in the AP group
                 were higher than those in the AM group. The total
                 antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT),
                 superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and
                 acid phosphatase (ACP) in the AP group were better than
                 those in the AM group. The Shannon--Wiener and Simpson
                 indices of the gut, water, and sediment of the AP
                 system were significantly higher than those in the AM
                 system, which implied a higher abundance of
                 microorganisms in the AP system. These results
                 demonstrate that the application of a water spinach
                 floating raft in aquaponics can not only improve the
                 water quality, but also improve the growth performance,
                 antioxidant system, and non-specific immune responses
                 of Pacific white shrimp, while increasing the abundance
                 of microorganisms in the aquaculture system and
                 improving the ecological benefits in terms of the
                 expenditure.",

                 trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. This study was conducted to
                 investigate the effects of different sources of dietary
                 astaxanthin on the growth, coloration, and antioxidant
                 capacity of the commercial-sized O. mykiss during
                 long-term feeding. Haematococcus pluvialis (HP), yeast
                 Phaffia rhodozyma (PR), and synthetic astaxanthin (SA)
                 were added to the basic feed (no astaxanthin, NA) to
                 prepare the isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental
                 diets; the actual astaxanthin content values in the
                 diets were 31.25, 32.96, and 31.50 mg/kg, respectively.
                 Eighteen hundred O. mykiss, averaging 670 {\pm} 20 g,
                 were randomly divided into four groups and then fed
                 with the experimental diet for four months. Dietary
                 supplementation of P. rhodozyma and synthetic
                 astaxanthin had no significant effects on the growth
                 and tissue indexes of O. mykiss. In contrast, dietary
                 supplementation with astaxanthin from H. pluvialis
                 significantly increased the weight gain rate after four
                 months of feeding. The fillet lightness of O. mykiss in
                 the PR and SA was statistically lower than that in the
                 NA and HP; the redness and astaxanthin content of
                 fillet in the HP, PR, and SA groups were statistically
                 higher than those in the NA. The total antioxidant
                 capacity of the liver and serum in the HP was
                 statistically higher than that in other diet groups,
                 and a higher liver total superoxide dismutase activity
                 was detected in the HP compared with the PR. Dietary
                 supplementation of astaxanthin significantly increased
                 the glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver and
                 serum, and the highest serum glutathione peroxidase
                 activity was detected in the HP, while dietary
                 astaxanthin significantly decreased the malondialdehyde
                 content in the liver and serum. Dietary supplementation
                 of PR significantly increased the fillet ash content,
                 while the highest fillet total lipid content was
                 detected in the HP. Dietary astaxanthin significantly
                 improved fillet redness and antioxidant capacity, among
                 which H. pluvialis astaxanthin has greater effects on

                 with surf zones being particularly crucial due to the
                 protection and abundant food resources they offer.
                 Among the species that rely on these areas are the
                 spotted seabass (\bioname{Dicentrarchus punctatus}) and
                 the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). This study

                 caspase8-like (CASP8-like) was isolated from
                 Crassostrea hongkongensis (C. hongkongensis) by

                 frame (ORF) encoding 533 amino acids with two conserved
                 death effector domains (DEDs) and a cysteine aspartase
                 cysteine structural domain (CASc). Amino acid sequence
                 comparison showed that ChCASP8-like shared the highest
                 identity (85.4\%) with CASP8-like of C. angulata. The
                 tissue expression profile showed that ChCASP8-like was
                 constitutively expressed in gills, hepatopancreas,
                 mantle, adductor muscle, hemocytes and gonads, and was
                 significantly upregulated in hemocytes, hepatopancreas

                 CASP8-like, CASP9 and CASP3, were significantly
                 activated by hyper-salinity stress, but were remarkably
                 inhibited by ChCASP8-like silencing. The caspase 8
                 activity was increased by 1.7-fold after hyper-salinity
                 stress, and was inhibited by 9.4\% by ChCASP8-like
                 silencing. Moreover, ChCASP8-like silencing clearly
                 alleviated the apoptosis resulting from hyper-salinity
                 stress. These results collectively demonstrated that

                 acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) gene in response to the
                 cold stress of M. rosenbergii, we investigated the

                 and the mortality of M. rosenbergii under cold stress.
                 The results showed that different siRNA sequences and
                 different injection concentrations had different
                 inhibiting effects on ACC gene expression, and
                 siRNA-III with an injection concentration of 2.0
                 {\mu}g/g (siRNA/prawn body weight) had the best

                 EchA was highly significantly down-regulated at 6 and
                 12 h in the muscles and gills; and ACOT was extremely

                 gills. Within 6--18 h after injection under cold
                 stress, the mortality rate of the siRNA interference
                 group (75\%) was much lower than that of the negative
                 (95\%) or blank control group (97.5\%), and all prawns
                 died after 24 h. In conclusion, RNA interference with
                 the ACC gene inhibited the expression of some fatty
                 acid metabolism-related genes, and could partly improve
                 the tolerance of M. rosenbergii to cold stress,
                 indicating that the ACC gene might play an important
                 role in the response of M. rosenbergii to cold
                 stress.",

                 diversity. Despite the crucial role of molecular data
                 in freshwater fish conservation management, there is a
                 scarcity of information regarding the genetic diversity
                 of Luciobarbus Heckel, 1843 (Actinopterygii,
                 Cyprinidae) populations in the Aral system. Therefore,
                 the primary aim of this study was to provide genetic
                 information on two native species of the Luciobarbus
                 genus found in the Aral system: L. conocephalus
                 (Kessler, 1872) and L. brachycephalus (Kessler, 1872).
                 These species, like many others in the Aral system,
                 confront the imminent threat of extinction due to
                 system alterations. However, genetic studies on these
                 species at the nuclear level are challenging because
                 Luciobarbus is an allotetraploid genus. Consequently,
                 genetic investigations thus far have focused mainly on
                 sequencing mitochondrial genes due to their haploid
                 nature. This study has successfully developed fifteen
                 new polymorphic microsatellite loci, which can prove to

  abstract =     "Fish in aquatic ecosystems are often impacted by
                 environmental stressors like temperature fluctuations
                 and exposure to heavy metals. Chromium (Cr 6+) is a
                 known environmental pollutant that poses a threat to
                 aquatic life. Various environmental factors, such as
                 water temperature, have been found to affect the
                 toxicity of dissolved chemicals in aquatic ecosystems.
                 We investigated the toxicity of combinations of
                 different concentrations of hexavalent chromium (Cr 6+
                 ) with high temperatures in fish. Hematological indices
                 demonstrated changes in white blood cells (WBCs),
                 hematocrit (HCT), red blood cells (RBCs), and
                 hemoglobin (Hb) levels during the exposure. The
                 qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of different
                 tissues confirmed that higher concentrations of Cr 6+
                 caused more significant damage than lower
                 concentrations, with evident alterations observed in
                 circulatory and regressive aspects. Furthermore, brain
                 acetylcholinesterase levels decreased in both single
                 heavy metal exposure and combined exposure at a high
                 temperature. The activity of antioxidant oxidase and
                 immunological parameters increased in all treatment
                 groups compared with the control group following
                 long-term exposure. A significant and increased effect
                 of Cr 6+ in the high-temperature groups was observed on
                 the evaluated biomarkers, suggesting a possible
                 synergistic effect between Cr 6+ and increased
                 temperature. The integrated biomarker response (IBR)
                 reported the highest level of stress at 10 mg/L Cr 6+
                 combined with high temperature. The IBR analysis
                 revealed that the highest activity of response enzymes,
                 such as acid phosphatase (ACP), superoxide dismutase
                 (SOD), and glutathione S-transferases (GST), was
                 observed in the liver, whereas the gills displayed
                 alkaline phosphatase (ALP), GST, and SOD activity, and
                 the kidneys demonstrated SOD, ACP, and aspartate
                 aminotransferase (AST) to be most active. Through
                 histopathology, antioxidant enzymes, and metabolism-
                 and immunity-related enzymes, we determined that high
                 temperatures enhance the potential toxicity of Cr 6+ in
                 fish. We recommend conducting a thorough assessment of
                 the impact of climate change, particularly temperature
                 fluctuations, when studying the toxic effects of metal
                 pollution, like chromium, in aquatic ecosystems.",

                 aquaculture tends to be limited by sustainability
                 issues, which include overdependency on fishmeal, the

                 One such effort is using functional feed additives in
                 feed formulation. Functional feed additives are dietary
                 ingredients incorporated in feed formulations, not only

                 incorporating functional feed additives such as
                 probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and phytogenics.

                 serve as decision-making tools in conservation and
                 fishery management. Natural reefs exhibited an
                 eight-times higher abundance of eggs, as well as the
                 highest abundance of larvae in the yolk-sac and
                 preflexion phases. In contrast, ARs had the highest
                 abundance of larvae in the flexion and postflexion
                 phases. Natural reefs may serve as breeding grounds for
                 Scaridae, Labridae, and Mugilidae; whereas, ARs may

                 the supply and settlement options of reef fishes and
                 consequently can lead to increased fish production with
                 potential benefits to adjacent fishing areas through

                 be sustainable, which can potentially be achieved by
                 the implementation of circular practices. Integrated
                 multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems promote the

                 study aims to explore the potential principles embedded
                 in IMTA and the existing alternatives to quantify
                 circularity. Two basic pillars (nutrient management and

                 relevant circularity attributes for IMTA systems and
                 were quantified through aquaculture-specific

                 selected to evaluate the circularity performance of
                 four IMTA trials in three aquaculture facilities in

                 interpretation of experimental results. Different
                 animal models have been employed to decrease
                 variability to enhance experimental power. However,
                 variation frequently persists among and within
                 strains/lines. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), inbred lines
                 (e.g., NHGRI-1) derived from wild-type lines have been
                 produced to greatly decrease genetic variation, with
                 the goal of providing better understanding of genetic
                 backgrounds that may influence the experimental outcome
                 of studies employing such lines. We hypothesized that
                 variations in morphological phenotypes shaped by
                 environmental stressors early in development are
                 correlated with the intrinsic degree of genetic
                 variability of zebrafish lines. We compared
                 morphological variability (yolk--chorion ratio, body
                 mass, embryo mass, total length, condition factor, and
                 specific growth rate) in wild-type AB and NHGRI-1
                 zebrafish lines as a function of their responses to
                 altered temperature and oxygen availability during the
                 first 7 days post-fertilization. Overall, both lines
                 showed similar developmental trajectories for
                 yolk--chorion ratio, embryo mass, and total length.
                 Additionally, condition factor and specific growth rate
                 showed similar responses within each line, regardless
                 of temperature and hypoxia. Importantly, the
                 coefficient of variation for each variable was
                 significantly lower in NHGRI-1 than AB larvae for 151
                 of 187 assessed morphological endpoints. Thus, the

                 most important pathogens in aquaculture worldwide,
                 causing high losses to farmed salmonids particularly
                 during early growth stages with significant economic
                 impact. Despite previous attempts, no effective vaccine
                 has been developed, and protection against introduction
                 into farms is difficult due to the ubiquitous
                 occurrence of the pathogen. A better understanding of
                 the mechanism of disease development is essential for
                 targeted therapeutic and preventive measures in farms.
                 Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of diseases caused by
                 F. psychrophilum has not been elucidated yet.
                 Previously, several putative virulence factors have

                 disease development, while others are probably
                 dispensable. The importance of some factors has not yet
                 been explored. This review focuses on the supposed
                 virulence factors of F. psychrophilum and the current

  abstract =     "Queen triggerfish Balistes vetula is an important
                 reef-associated species for commercial fisheries in the
                 U.S. Caribbean. It exhibits a relatively unique
                 reproductive strategy as a nesting benthic spawner,
                 investing substantial energy in territorial defense,
                 building and maintaining nests, and caring for
                 fertilized eggs during the reproductive season. Prior
                 to this study, no comprehensive life history
                 information existed in the literature for queen
                 triggerfish. This study provides the first
                 comprehensive documentation of age, growth, size/age at
                 sexual maturity, reproductive seasonality, and
                 reproductive output for a Balistes species in the
                 Caribbean. From 2013 to 2023, we collected 2190 fish
                 samples from fisheries-dependent and -independent
                 sources from the waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S.
                 Virgin Islands. Fish ranged from 67 to 477 mm fork
                 length (FL). We documented that queen triggerfish is
                 sexually dimorphic with males attaining larger mean
                 sizes-at-age compared to females and the species is
                 characterized by a moderately young age at median
                 sexual maturity (A 50 = 3.3 y). The maximum age for our
                 U.S. Caribbean samples was 23 y based on increment
                 counts from otoliths. Spawning season encompassed the
                 months of December to August in the region, and female
                 spawning frequency ranged from an estimated 2 to 84
                 times per year; female spawning frequency increased
                 with increasing size and age of fish. We documented
                 that commercial fishers in the U.S. Caribbean mainly
                 target ``plate-size'' individuals, defined in our study
                 as 235--405 mm FL, which appears to act as a
                 self-imposed slot size range limit and results in the
                 fishery not removing individuals in the smallest and
                 largest size groups at high rates. The percentage of
                 immature fish from fisheries-dependent sources was
                 close to 0 (0.8\%). Commercial fishing for queen
                 triggerfish in the region currently appears to be
                 sustainable, but monitoring of the population should
                 continue.",

                 four S. marmoratus populations, including one farmed
                 population, one released population and two wild
                 populations. A total of 68 haplotypes from 123
                 individuals were detected, including 3 shared
                 haplotypes. Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.944 to
                 0.980, with a mean of 0.966. The nucleotide diversity
                 ranged from 0.020 to 0.025, with a mean of 0.022.
                 Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) indicated that

                 and the index of genetic differentiation between
                 populations (F ST) among the four populations showed no
                 differentiation. The results indicate that the current
                 artificial enhancement and release has not impacted the

                 to fishing, product safety, and climate change in the
                 Adriatic Sea region. The examination of product safety
                 focuses on the assessment of contaminants originating
                 from human activities such as industry, mining,
                 agriculture, and household waste disposal. The
                 contamination of the aquatic environment has emerged as
                 a pressing global concern, extending to the Adriatic
                 basin. Aquatic organisms, including fish, are prone to
                 accumulating pollutants directly from polluted water
                 sources and indirectly through the food web. The
                 bio-accumulation of potentially hazardous substances,
                 particularly heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, PAHs, and
                 antibiotic resistance in aquatic organisms, poses a
                 significant threat to human health. Climate change
                 effects will deplete our seafood supply in terms of
                 quantity and safety owing to negative consequences such
                 as higher levels of pollution, parasites, viruses,
                 infections, acidification, and toxicities such as
                 shellfish poisoning. Global food safety strategies
                 should be developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
                 and promote environmentally friendly technology, which
                 indirectly affects seafood quality and microbiological
                 safety, especially for the Adriatic Sea, which is part
                 of the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by the most

                 chemical (EDC) that has been shown to affect bone
                 development in mammals. However, the detrimental
                 impacts of NP on the skeletal growth and development of
                 aquatic species, especially bony fish, remain poorly
                 understood. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), essential
                 for bone formation and osteoblast differentiation, act
                 through the BMP-Smad signaling pathway. In this study,
                 two BMP genes, BMP2 and BMP4, were cloned and
                 characterized in the red crucian carp (Carassius
                 auratus red var.). The full-length cDNAs of BMP2 and
                 BMP4 were 2029 bp and 2095 bp, respectively, encoding
                 polypeptides of 411 and 433 amino acids, and share a
                 typical TGF-{\beta} domain with other BMPs. The tissue
                 expression patterns of both genes were identified,
                 showing ubiquitous expression across all studied
                 tissues. Additionally, the exposure of embryos or adult
                 fish to NP stress resulted in a downregulation of BMP2,
                 BMP4, and other genes associated with the BMP-Smad
                 signaling pathway. Moreover, the combined treatment of
                 adult fish with NP and the specific BMP receptor
                 inhibitor significantly reduced these genes'
                 expression. These findings elucidate the mechanism of
                 NP stress on BMP2 and BMP4, suggesting a role for the
                 BMP-Smad signaling pathway in the response to
                 endocrine-disrupting chemicals in fish.",

                 attention by the scientific community in comparison to
                 subterranean fishes which have lost eyes and
                 pigmentation. They constitute a largely unexplored
                 component of marine fish diversity, except for the
                 relatively well-studied marine caves of the
                 Mediterranean Sea. These habitats are characterized by
                 steep environmental gradients of decreasing light and
                 decreasing water exchange. The fishes recorded so far
                 in marine caves are not exclusive residents of this
                 habitat and they are also present at least in the other
                 mesolithial habitats. In the Mediterranean marine
                 caves, 132 fishes have been recorded to date,
                 representing about 17\% of the total Mediterranean fish
                 species richness. Most of these species are reported
                 from the anterior cave zones where some light still
                 exists, while a smaller number of species are known
                 from the totally dark zones. Among them, 27.3\% are
                 accidental visitors, 53.8\% are the regular mesolithial
                 visitors and switchers between mesolithion and open
                 water, 5.3\% are permanent residents of the
                 mesolithion, but also occur in other habitats, and
                 13.6\% are exclusive permanent residents of
                 mesolithion. Some mesolithial exclusive permanent
                 residents recorded in marine caves share similar
                 morphology, probably as adaptations to these

                 allows farmers to take swift action to protect fish
                 health and prevent economic losses. This paper proposes
                 an enhanced high-precision detection algorithm based on

                 feature extraction module was introduced to replace the
                 original RepNCSPELAN4 module. This change improves the
                 model's detection accuracy for high-density and
                 occluded fish in complex water environments while
                 reducing the computational cost. Secondly, the proposed
                 DCNv4-Dyhead detection head enhances the model's
                 multi-scale feature learning capability, effectively
                 recognizes various abnormal fish behaviors, and
                 improves the computational speed. Lastly, to address
                 the issue of sample imbalance in the abnormal fish
                 behavior dataset, we propose EMA-SlideLoss, which
                 enhances the model's focus on hard samples, thereby
                 improving the model's robustness. The experimental
                 results demonstrate that the DDEYOLOv9 model achieves
                 high Precision , Recall , and mean~Average~Precision (
                 mAP) on the ``Abnormal Behavior Dataset of Takifugu
                 rubripes '', with values of 91.7\%, 90.4\%, and 94.1\%,
                 respectively. Compared to the YOLOv9 model, these
                 metrics are improved by 5.4\%, 5.5\%, and 5.4\%,
                 respectively. The model also achieves a running speed
                 of 119 frames per second (FPS), which is 45 FPS faster
                 than YOLOv9. Experimental results show that the
                 DDEYOLOv9 algorithm can accurately and efficiently
                 identify and quantify abnormal fish behaviors in
                 specific complex environments.",

                 environment is a major concern for the conservation of
                 biodiversity. Numerous studies show the detrimental
                 effects of MPs on marine species, especially because of
                 their small size and their capacity to absorb organic
                 contaminants from their surroundings. The bivalve
                 mollusk Cerastoderma glaucum (Brugui{\`e}re, 1789),
                 because of its wide geographic distribution and
                 immobile feeding habits, can be used as a sentinel and
                 bioindicator species. By examining the presence,
                 localization, and co-localization of Toll-like receptor
                 2 (TLR2) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS),
                 this study aims to evaluate the response of the
                 internal defense system of C. glaucum to pristine MPs
                 through the employment of confocal microscopy and
                 bioinformatics techniques. The results show haemocytes
                 immunoreactive to the antibodies tested; in particular,
                 a higher number of TLR2-positive haemocytes can be
                 observed in the group exposed to pristine MPs. These
                 findings suggest that haemocytes can play a key
                 biomarker role as sentinels to environmental
                 pollutants. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses on the
                 antibodies tested confirmed an evolutionary
                 conservation of these molecules. These data highlight
                 the critical role of phagocytosis in identifying
                 ecosystem damage and are helpful in developing
                 biosensors with less negative effects on the

                 juvenile Sebastes schlegelii to air exposure stress by
                 identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that
                 may underlie their anti-stress mechanisms. Juvenile
                 Sebastes schlegelii were subjected to varying durations
                 of air exposure stress. The total RNA was extracted
                 from whole tissues and sequenced using the Illumina
                 NovaSeq 6000 platform. The transcriptome data were
                 analyzed to identify DEGs through pairwise comparisons
                 across a control group and two experimental groups
                 exposed to air for 40 s and 2 min 30 s, respectively.
                 The comparative DEG analysis revealed a significant
                 number of transcripts responding to air exposure
                 stress. Specifically, 5173 DEGs were identified in the
                 40 s exposure group (BS) compared to the control (BC),
                 6742 DEGs in the 2 min 30 s exposure group (BD)
                 compared to the control (BC), and 2653 DEGs when
                 comparing the BD to the BS group. Notably, Gene
                 Ontology (GO) analysis showed an enrichment of DEGs
                 associated with peptidase activity and extracellular
                 regions, suggesting a role in the organism's stress
                 response. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
                 (KEGG) pathway analysis pointed to the involvement of
                 metabolic pathways, which are crucial for energy
                 management under stress. The upregulation of protein
                 digestion and absorption pathways may indicate a
                 physiological adaptation to nutrient scarcity during
                 stress. Additionally, the identification of antibiotic
                 biosynthesis pathways implies a potential role in
                 combating stress-induced infections or damage. The
                 identified DEGs and enriched pathways provide insights
                 into the complex anti-stress response mechanisms in
                 juvenile Sebastes schlegelii. The enrichment of
                 peptidase activity and extracellular region-related
                 genes may reflect the initiation of tissue repair and
                 immune response following air exposure. The connection
                 between protein digestion and absorption pathways and
                 anti-stress capabilities could be interpreted as a
                 metabolic readjustment to prioritize energy-efficient
                 processes and nutrient assimilation during stress. The
                 role of antibiotic biosynthesis pathways suggests a
                 defensive mechanism against oxidative stress or
                 microbial invasion that might occur with air
                 exposure.",

                 in August and decreased by late autumn. Pelagic
                 stingray may aggregate on the continental shelf during

                 movement pattern is considered in relation to the
                 reproductive cycle and overwintering. At-vessel
                 mortality was low, but there was varying evidence of
                 post-release mortality, indicating the need for further

                 virulence factor, plays a crucial role in successful
                 infection with M. bicuspidata. Therefore, this study
                 aims to investigate the transcriptome response of M.
                 bicuspidata to low- and high-iron conditions. Overall,
                 1082 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR {$<$}
                 0.05, |log 2 FC {\geq} 1.5|) were identified,
                 comprising 977 and 105 DEGs, in response to low- and
                 high-iron conditions, respectively. These genes
                 predominantly participate in altering metabolism, cell
                 membranes, or cellular structure, allowing the organism
                 to adapt to varying iron levels. Iron
                 limitation-induced genes play crucial roles in energy
                 metabolism, transport, and catabolism pathways.
                 Moreover, 27 ortholog genes were associated with iron
                 transport and homeostasis, with 7 of them participating
                 in iron uptake and regulation under low-iron
                 conditions. This study contributes to the comprehension
                 of iron homeostasis in aquatic fungi. It may offer
                 potential therapeutic strategies for managing M.

                 Steindachneridion parahybae, focusing on the aggressive
                 behavior of females. This study characterizes the
                 vasotocinergic system using immunohistochemistry,
                 highlighting the potential influence of
                 arginine-vasotocin (AVT) on reproductive physiology.
                 Two experimental groups were proposed: (A) control,
                 with one female in the aquarium, and (B) experimental,
                 with two females in the same aquarium. Dominant (D)
                 females presented a more aggressive behavior and did
                 not show any injury. They apparently had a length and
                 body mass higher than injured nondominant (ND) females.
                 The analysis identified positive AVT immunoreactive
                 (ir) neurons exclusively within the preoptic area,
                 including parvocellular, magnocellular, and
                 gigantocellular subpopulations, containing fibers-ir
                 extending into the pituitary gland. Cellular and
                 nuclear areas were greater in D compared to ND in the
                 magnocellular subpopulation. There were no differences
                 between parvocellular and gigantocellular
                 subpopulations. There was a difference on the steroid
                 plasma profile of cortisol (more in ND than in D) and
                 17{\alpha},20{\beta}-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (more in
                 D than in ND). Furthermore, control and D females
                 presented higher optical densities for AVT-ir,
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone-ir, and luteinizing
                 hormone-ir than ND. In general, there were no
                 differences in the results of female (control group)
                 with D females. The AVT system is highly complex,
                 possibly counting multiple sites of action during
                 artificial reproduction and acting directly and/or
                 indirectly associated with behavioral and physiological

  abstract =     "Conventional structures associated with stream
                 crossings such as bridges and culverts can lead to
                 zones of high-velocity water flow that impede fish
                 passage. Such obstacles are likely to harm native fish
                 populations by impacting migrations critical to their
                 life history strategies, causing habitat fragmentation
                 and extirpation, thereby limiting population growth and
                 distribution. Due to the high rates of human population
                 growth and development occurring in Texas, this is an
                 issue of particular concern for fish designated as
                 species of greatest conservation need (SGCN). This
                 project focused on four SGCN fishes native to the
                 Edwards Plateau Ecoregion, namely the Guadalupe Bass,
                 Guadalupe Roundnose Minnow, Guadalupe Darter, and
                 Plateau Shiner, at both adult (all species) and
                 juvenile (Guadalupe Bass only) life stages. Our primary
                 aim was to aid in the design of future culverts
                 associated with stream crossings (or the modification
                 of existing culverts) so that the water velocities
                 through these structures do not exceed the swimming
                 capacities of our target SGCN fishes. To this end, we
                 assessed their maximum sustained swimming speeds (U
                 crit) under a typical range of Edwards Plateau stream
                 temperatures (15, 22.5, and 30 {$^\circ $}C) to be used
                 in site-specific calculations of the maximum allowable
                 culvert water velocities (Vf). A secondary objective
                 was to collect physiological endpoints of relevance to
                 the overall swimming performance including the maximum
                 burst swimming speeds (U max), metabolic rate
                 measurements (i.e., standard metabolic rate (SMR),
                 maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope (AS)),
                 cost of transport (COT), and optimal swimming speed (U
                 opt). Temperature-related effects were observed that
                 can be used to inform site-specific culvert designs. In
                 general, the highest U crit values for the tested
                 species were near, or possibly between, 22.5 and 30
                 {$^\circ $}C, while U max stayed relatively consistent

                 Mercury values obtained using a Milestone DMA 80 evo
                 direct mercury analyzer varied both within and among
                 sites. Total mercury concentrations (mg kg {$-$1} dry
                 weight) ranged from the lowest at a protected location
                 at Isabela Island (0.06 {\pm} 0.02) to the highest at
                 the San Crist{\'o}bal urban location (2.04 {\pm}

                 {\pm} 0.6. Values from urban sites at Isabela Island
                 and Academy Bay, Santa Cruz, had intermediate values.
                 When converted to wet weight, crabs from both San

                 order to study the pharmacokinetics of cefotaxime in
                 shrimp hepatopancreases and plasma, as well as its
                 withdrawal time related to a maximum residue limit
                 (MRL) in shrimp muscle. Pharmacokinetics parameters
                 were investigated through oral medication at a single
                 dose of 25 mg/kg shrimp body weight and subsequent
                 hepatopancreas and plasma cefotaxime concentration
                 measurements at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after
                 shrimp were fed with medication. The maximum
                 concentration of cefotaxime was observed after one hour
                 in the hepatopancreas (C max, 19.45 {\pm} 2.10 mg/kg)
                 and 4 h in plasma (0.184 {\pm} 0.061 mg/L). Based on a
                 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefotaxime of
                 4.13 mg/L against Vibrio parahaemolyticus (known to
                 cause acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)
                 in white leg shrimp), it was observed that the time
                 during which the hepatopancreas cefotaxime
                 concentration was above the MIC was 23 h. An every 24 h
                 cefotaxime treatment could thus be effective in
                 fighting against this bacterium in shrimp. The
                 withdrawal time of cefotaxime was determined after
                 shrimp were fed with medicated feed once a day and
                 twice a day for three consecutive days. Shrimp muscle
                 was collected on day 1 and day 3 during medication and
                 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after medication was stopped.
                 Considering an MRL of 50 {\mu}g/kg, the withdrawal
                 times were 8.5 degree-days (corresponding to 6.9 h at

                 at 29.5 {$^\circ $}C) after shrimp were fed with
                 medicated feed twice a day for 3 days. Moreover,
                 histological analysis revealed that feeding shrimp with
                 cefotaxime at the given dose in once- or twice-a-day
                 treatments did not negatively impact the shrimp

                 antagonises heavy metal toxicity and enhances the
                 antioxidant capacity of organisms. Lactobacillus
                 plantarum (L. plantarum) can reduce the toxicity of
                 heavy metals through adsorption, reduction and
                 metabolism. Studies have confirmed that the biological
                 synthesis of Se nanoparticles (Bio-SeNPs) using
                 bacterial microorganisms is simple, safe and less toxic
                 than the synthesis of inorganic and organic Se, but the
                 effect on Cd-induced immunosuppression is un-known. One
                 hundred and eighty Bulatmai barbel (Luciobarbus capito:
                 L. capito) plants were randomly divided into control
                 (C), Cd and Cd + Se-enriched L. plantarum groups
                 (S1L1-Cd) and fed for 28 days. The analysis methods
                 included histopathology, test kits, transcriptomics and
                 real-time quantitative PCR. The addition of
                 selenium-enriched L. plantarum significantly attenuated
                 cadmium-induced pathological changes such as glomerular
                 atrophy, detachment of renal tubular epithelial cells,
                 mild swelling, and interstitial inflammatory cell
                 infiltration. Cd stress can lead to significant
                 decreases in RBC, HCT, WBC, LZM, C3, and IgM levels,
                 and the addition of Se-enriched L. plantarum can
                 significantly reverse the changes in these indicators.
                 Transcriptomic analysis revealed 488 DEGs in the Cd
                 groups, 301 of which were upregulated and 187 of which
                 were downregulated. There were 1474 DEGs in the S1L1-Cd
                 group, of which 720 were upregulated and 754 were
                 downregulated. In addition, GO enrichment analysis
                 revealed that the biological regulation of the most
                 differentially expressed genes involved metal ion
                 binding, ATP binding and nucleotide inclusion. KEGG
                 enrichment analysis revealed six of the most enriched
                 pathways: oxidative phosphorylation, Huntington
                 disease, retrograde endocannabinoid signalling, natural
                 killer cell-mediated cyto-toxicity, the IL-17
                 signalling pathway, and leukocyte transient migration.
                 Moreover, we selected 12 DEGs for qRT-PCR, which showed
                 that the qRT-PCR results were consistent with our
                 RNA-Seq results. Our results suggest that Se-enriched
                 L. plantarum can enhance immunity and alleviate Cd
                 exposure-mediated immunosuppression in L. capito.",

  abstract =     "The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is an
                 important commercial fish. Studies have shown that
                 probiotics can promote the healthy growth of fish. In
                 this study, we assessed the impact of an endogenous
                 Bacillus subtilis strain (RT-BS07) on the growth,
                 survival and immunological response of juvenile rainbow
                 trout. Additionally, the morphology of rainbow trout's
                 intestinal tissue was measured. Control (CT) and
                 experimental groups (B) were fed with conventional and
                 probiotic-supplemented diets (1.0 $ \times $ 10 8 CFU
                 per gram) for 42 days, respectively. Following feeding,
                 a challenge experiment was carried out with Aeromonas
                 hydrophila at 1.0 $ \times $ 10 7 CFU/mL to determine
                 the experimental fish's tolerance to the bacteria. The
                 results showed that the weight gain rate (WGR) in group
                 B was 118.2\%, which was significantly higher than that
                 in group CT (54.86\%) after 42 days. The height of
                 intestinal villi and the number of goblet cells
                 increased in group B, thus increasing the resistance of
                 rainbow trout to pathogenic bacteria. The alkaline
                 phosphatase (AKP) activity (U/mg prot) in the liver,
                 spleen and intestinal tissues of group B was
                 significantly higher than that in the CT group. The
                 expression of interleukin-1{\beta} (IL-1{\beta}) in the
                 intestinal tissue of group B was 6-fold higher than
                 that in group CT. Furthermore, the expression of growth
                 hormone-2 (GH-2) in the spleen was 3-fold higher than
                 that in group CT. After 12 days of A. hydrophila
                 injection, the survival rate was 40\% and 70\% in group
                 CT and group B, respectively. Collectively, the present
                 study demonstrated that the addition of endogenous B.
                 subtilis strain (1.0 $ \times $ 10 8 CFU per gram) to
                 the feed can effectively promote the growth of rainbow
                 trout and enhance immunity, which is beneficial to
                 rainbow trout culture.",

                 with 75\% vegetable oil (VO) inclusion were formulated
                 for juvenile gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). As VO,
                 one diet contained palm oil (diet P), another rapeseed
                 oil (diet R), and the other three included linseed oil
                 (L) combined with the above-mentioned VOs (named PL, RL
                 and RPL diets). After 18 weeks, pyloric caeca (PC) and
                 proximal intestine (PI) were analyzed for oxidative
                 stress biomarkers, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and gene

                 regions, catalase in PC and glutathione reductase in
                 PI; rapeseed oil reduced the glutathione peroxidase
                 (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase activities in PC,
                 and palm oil upregulated GPx activity in PI. The PL
                 diet triggered LPO levels in the PI, and RPL-fed fish
                 showed the highest levels of LPO in the PC due to lower
                 antioxidant activities, while RL-fed fish presented the
                 best oxidative status. The results suggest that the
                 dietary amount of n-6 and the unsaturated/saturated

                 oxidative stress according to photoperiod and light
                 wavelength. We confirmed that the pigment layer was
                 significantly thicker in the group irradiated with
                 light for 24 h (LL), but that its thickness did not
                 differ significantly with light wavelength.
                 Additionally, light wavelength changes did not cause a
                 significant change in H 2 O 2 concentration until 5
                 days after the change in the light environment.
                 However, a significantly higher H 2 O 2 concentration

                 sea area of China, but the threat of disease is
                 becoming more and more serious. Vibrio harveyi, V.
                 parahaemolyticus, and Singapore grouper iridovirus
                 (SGIV) are three important pathogens that cause disease
                 in groupers, and infection with either a single one or
                 a mix of these pathogens poses a serious threat to the
                 healthy development of grouper culture. To enhance the
                 rapid diagnosis and screening in the early stages, it
                 is necessary to develop rapid detection methods of
                 these pathogens. To simultaneously and rapidly detect
                 the three pathogens, in this study, we utilized the
                 TolC of V. harveyi, DNAJ of V. parahaemolyticus, and
                 RAD2 of SGIV as the target genes and established a
                 triple visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification
                 (LAMP) method. This LAMP method showed a detection time
                 as fast as 30 min and a high sensitivity of 100
                 fg/{\mu}L. Moreover, this method exhibited strong
                 specificity and no cross-reaction with seven types of
                 Vibrio and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as five
                 common viruses in aquatic animals. Then, the LAMP
                 products were enzymically cut, and three characteristic
                 strips were used to identify the pathogen species. The
                 results of the clinical trials demonstrated that the
                 method could accurately and specifically detect V.
                 harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, and SGIV in grouper

                 established a triple visual LAMP rapid detection method
                 for V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, and SGIV. The

                 specificity, high sensitivity, and visual results. It
                 is suitable for the early and rapid diagnosis of
                 groupers infected with V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus,
                 and SGIV, thereby providing useful technical support

  abstract =     "This study introduces a method for quantitatively
                 assessing the complexity and predictability of fish
                 behavior in closed systems through the application of
                 information entropy, offering a novel lens through
                 which to understand how fish adapt to environmental
                 changes. Utilizing simulations rooted in a random walk
                 model for fish movement, we delve into entropy
                 fluctuations under varying environmental conditions,
                 including responses to feeding and external stimuli.
                 Our findings underscore the utility of information
                 entropy in capturing the intricacies of fish behavior,
                 particularly highlighting the synchrony in collective
                 actions and adaptations to environmental shifts. This
                 research not only broadens our comprehension of fish
                 behavior but also paves the way for its application in
                 fields like aquaculture and resource management.
                 Through our analysis, we discovered that smaller grid
                 sizes in simulations capture detailed local
                 fluctuations, while larger grids elucidate general
                 trends, pinpointing a 2.5 grid as optimal for our
                 study. Moreover, changes in swimming speeds and
                 behavioral adaptations during feeding were
                 quantitatively analyzed, with results illustrating
                 significant behavior modifications. Additionally,
                 employing a Gaussian mixture model helped to clarify
                 the nuanced changes in fish behavior in response to
                 altered light conditions, demonstrating the layered
                 complexity of fish responses to environmental stimuli.
                 This investigation confirms the efficacy of information
                 entropy as a robust metric for evaluating fish shoal
                 behavior, offering a fresh methodology for ecological
                 and environmental studies, with promising implications

  abstract =     "Fish growth is a fundamental biological process driven
                 by a multitude of intrinsic (within-individual) and
                 extrinsic (environmental) factors that underpin
                 individual fitness and population dynamics. Interannual
                 variability in river hydrology regarding the intensity
                 and duration of floods and droughts can induce
                 interannual variations in the biotic and abiotic
                 variables that regulate fish growth. However, the
                 understanding of how interannual variability in river
                 hydrology affects fish growth remains limited for most
                 species and ecosystems. We evaluated how inter-annual
                 hydrological variations within the Amazon River basin
                 influence the growth of the catfish Pseudoplaystoma
                 fasciatum. Our research questions were as follows: Do
                 floods lead to the faster growth of P. fasciatum and
                 droughts lead to the slower growth? And do floods and
                 droughts affect all age classes in the same manner? We
                 sampled 364 specimens of P. fasciatum from five sites
                 in the Amazon basin, estimated their growth rates, and
                 related the growth rates to indices of the intensity of
                 floods and droughts. We fitted linear mixed-effects
                 models to test the relationship between growth
                 increments and hydrological indices (with F and D
                 quantifying the intensities of floods and droughts,
                 respectively), age as fixed effects, and basins and
                 Fish ID as random effects. We found an inverse
                 relationship between the increment width in the fish
                 hard parts and hydrological indices. That is, intense
                 floods and droughts negatively affected the growth
                 rates. We also found that the growth of P. fasciatum
                 was no different in years with intense and mild floods
                 across age classes 1--5, although was different for age
                 class 6. However, the growth of P. fasciatum was faster
                 in years of mild droughts for all age classes. Our
                 results showing that the growth of P. fasciatum was
                 slower in years of intense droughts are supported by
                 those of previous studies in the Amazon basin and
                 elsewhere. However, our results showing for the first
                 time that the growth of P. fasciatum is slower in years
                 of intense flooding is the opposite of patterns found
                 in other studies. These results thus suggest that the
                 growth of P. fasciatum is maximized within an optimum
                 range of hydrological conditions, where neither floods
                 nor droughts are intense.",

                 analysis. Five functional classifications, which
                 included 16 functional traits, four functional alpha
                 diversity indices (functional richness, functional
                 evenness, functional divergence, and community-weighted
                 mean), three functional beta diversity indices
                 (functional beta diversity and its turnover and
                 nestedness components), and 14 bottom environmental
                 factors were considered. The dominant traits of fish
                 communities were the following: benthivorous feeding
                 habits, small and front-facing mouths, high trophic
                 level, demersal, anguilliform, low growth coefficient,
                 medium resilience, low vulnerability, and adapted to
                 warm temperate conditions. The dominant migration
                 traits and types of fish eggs varied by year, and fish
                 abundance was the main factor affecting the dominant
                 traits of the communities. The results of multiple
                 regression on distance matrices and variance
                 partitioning analysis indicated that ammonia nitrogen
                 content, total phosphorus content, and pH were the main
                 environmental factors that affected fish functional
                 diversity. The N/P ratio had a bottom-up control effect
                 on fish functional diversity. Our findings also
                 revealed that high pH gradients and distant
                 geographical distances can inhibit trait turnover in

                 semi-arid Murray--Darling Basin (MDB) in south-eastern
                 Australia is considered at high ecological risk, with
                 substantial declines in native fish populations already
                 identified and climate change threats looming. This
                 places great importance on the collection and use of
                 data to document population trends over large spatial
                 extents, inform management decisions, and provide
                 baselines from which change can be measured. We used
                 two medium-term data sets (10 MDB basin-wide fish
                 surveys from 2004--2022) covering the 23 catchments and
                 68 sub-catchments of the MDB to investigate trends in
                 the distribution of common riverine species at the
                 entire basin scale. Fifteen native species were
                 analysed for changes in their contemporary range, and
                 whilst short-term changes were identified, all species
                 showed no significant continuous trend over the study
                 period. We further analysed the native species extent
                 relative to their historic records, with bony herring
                 and golden perch occurring in 78\% and 68\% of their
                 historic river kilometres, respectively, whereas
                 southern pygmy perch, northern river blackfish, silver
                 perch, mountain galaxias, and freshwater catfish were
                 all estimated to occur in less than 10\% of their
                 historic extent. Six established non-native species
                 were also analysed and were very consistent in extent
                 over the years, suggesting that they are near the
                 available limits of expansion of their invasion. We
                 provide effect sizes for the spatial extent index which

                 performance, physiological parameters, and biochemical
                 composition of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). A total of
                 180 carp, with an average initial weight of 65 g, were
                 reared in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS).
                 They were divided into a control group (C), fed with a
                 diet containing 0\% GP, and two experimental groups (V1
                 and V2), fed with diets containing 5\% and 10\% GP,

                 Results revealed that most growth parameters were not

                 intestinal content showed that GP inclusion in fish
                 diets influenced microbial parameters, particularly
                 affecting the abundance of aerobic germs and
                 Enterobacteriaceae.",

                 critically endangered migratory fish native to the
                 Yangtze River estuary, is experiencing alarming
                 population declines. Understanding the physiological
                 and biochemical profiles of this species is paramount
                 for its conservation. However, due to limited sample
                 availability, blood biochemical parameters have
                 remained understudied. In this study, we examined blood
                 chemistry in artificially cultured Chinese sturgeon
                 ranging from 2 to 15 years of age. Our results revealed
                 age-related trends: total protein (TP), albumin (ALB),
                 globulin (GLO), total cholesterol (CHOL), high-density
                 lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),
                 estrogen (E 2), testosterone (T), testosterone
                 undecanoate (11-KT), and red blood cell count (RBC)
                 increased with age, while glucose (GLU), uric acid
                 (UA), and serum creatinine (CREA) decreased. Levels of
                 C-reactive protein (CRP) declined from 3 to 7 years but
                 rose from 8 to 15 years. Blood parameters showed
                 stabilization with age, indicating enhanced resilience
                 and immunity. Significant alterations in parameters at
                 ages 2--3 and 14--15 suggest critical developmental
                 stages. These findings are crucial for understanding
                 sturgeon growth, development, migration, and
                 reproduction, underscoring the necessity for targeted
                 conservation efforts during pivotal life stages.",

                 on the behavioral responses and physiological states of
                 the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). The
                 test fish, with an average body weight of approximately
                 352.81 {\pm} 70.99 g, were exposed to one hour of
                 acoustic stimulation at seven different frequencies:
                 100 Hz, 125 Hz, 160 Hz, 200 Hz, 500 Hz, 630 Hz, and 800
                 Hz. The aim was to delineate the specific effects of
                 acoustic stimulation on the behavior and physiological
                 indices. The results show that acoustic stimulation
                 significantly altered the behavioral patterns of the
                 large yellow croaker, predominantly manifested as
                 avoidance behavior towards the sound source. At a
                 stimulus frequency of 630 Hz, the test fish exhibited
                 continuous irregular motion and erratic swimming.
                 Physiologically, one hour of exposure to acoustic
                 stimulation notably affected the endocrine system. The
                 levels of Epinephrine and thyroxine were significantly
                 elevated at 200 Hz, while the cortisol levels did not
                 show significant differences. Additionally, the lactic
                 acid content significantly increased at 800 Hz, and the
                 blood glucose content peaked at 630 Hz. This study
                 discovered that sound frequencies of 200 Hz, 630 Hz,
                 and 800 Hz led to a significant increase in the levels
                 of Epinephrine, glucose, thyroid hormones, and lactate
                 in large yellow croaker, consequently affecting their
                 behavior. The changes in these physiological indicators
                 reflect the stress response of the large yellow croaker
                 in specific sonic environments, providing crucial
                 insights into the physiological and behavioral

                 populations throughout much of North America.
                 Poststocking survival is variable, and many
                 jurisdictions are experimenting with stocking
                 Muskellunge at advanced life stages (e.g., yearlings)
                 or sizes to promote more consistent recruitment within
                 populations. Yet, little is known about short-term
                 poststocking behavior or survival of Muskellunge in
                 natural lakes or if stocking larger fish results in
                 improved poststocking survival. Radiotelemetry was used
                 to evaluate the behavior and survival of large (mean of
                 418 mm; standard error of 3.4) spring-stocked yearling
                 Muskellunge in two northern Iowa natural lakes of
                 varying biotic and abiotic complexity. Hatchery-reared
                 Muskellunge were fitted with radio transmitters (n =
                 10--15 fish/lake), stocked in each lake with
                 conspecifics, and tracked either daily or weekly up to
                 112 days poststocking. Telemetry data were used to
                 evaluate dispersal and movement, depth and vegetation
                 use, proximity to shore, and survival. In both lakes,
                 fish dispersed rapidly from each stocking site.
                 Movement among lakes was similar and peaked during the
                 first week poststocking and declined thereafter.
                 Muskellunge were frequently located in offshore
                 habitats in both lakes, but both depth and vegetation
                 use varied among lakes and weeks poststocking, with
                 Muskellunge found in deeper, more vegetated habitats in
                 the larger, more complex natural lake. Muskellunge in
                 both systems had high poststocking survival
                 (86.7--90.0\%). The results of this study provide
                 managers with more information regarding yearling
                 Muskellunge poststocking behavior and survival and
                 indicate that larger fish may be a suitable alternative
                 for fisheries where high poststocking mortality may be
                 acting as a bottleneck for maintaining quality

                 mislabeling status of imported seafood in Thailand
                 using the DNA barcoding technique. A total of 45
                 imported seafood products from five distributors were
                 included. Scientific, common, local, and market names
                 of seafood samples were obtained from FAO and Fishbase
                 databases. DNA was extracted, and PCR was performed
                 using a universal primer targeting the COI gene.
                 Species of each sample were identified with over 98\%
                 similarity based on COI sequence analysis. DNA sequence
                 revealed 11 mislabeled samples. Among substituted
                 species, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus and Thunnus
                 maccoyii were found to be endangered species according
                 to IUCN status. Products obtained from Brand-C showed

                 Opsariichthys bidens) is becoming increasingly popular
                 due to its high nutritional value and delicious taste.
                 However, anthropogenic influences have caused a rapid
                 reduction in its population. Considering long-term
                 development sustainability, it is essential to conduct
                 research on its reproductive development. In this
                 study, the germ-cell related genes dazl (Obdazl) and
                 dnd (Obdnd) were cloned, and their expression patterns
                 were revealed. RT-PCR analysis indicated that Obdazl
                 and Obdnd were specifically expressed in gonads. In the
                 testis, Obdazl and Obdnd RNAs have a similar expression
                 pattern: their transcripts were abundant in
                 spermatogonia, gradually decreased, and eventually
                 disappeared during spermatogenesis. Early oocytes in
                 the ovary exhibited strong expression of Obdazl and
                 Obdnd RNAs and reduced remarkably after peak expression
                 at III oocytes. Surprisingly, Obdazl RNA was
                 dynamically found in perinuclear spots that finally
                 aggregated into the Balbiani body (Bb) in the early
                 oocytes. Moreover, Obdazl 3{\prime} UTR enabled the
                 reporter gene to be expressed stably in medaka PGCs,
                 suggesting that dazl was identified as the germ cell
                 marker in O. bidens, which may provide perspectives for

  abstract =     "Coastal fisheries are vital for food supply,
                 employment, and social stability. However, overfishing
                 is a common problem, often attributed to open access.
                 Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURFs) have gained
                 popularity as a tool to improve the sustainability of
                 coastal fisheries, but research on TURFs in China is
                 limited. This paper examines the island reef fishery
                 lease policy implemented in Shengsi County, Zhejiang
                 Province, within the Ma'an Islands National Marine
                 Special Reserve. The policy leases the use of island
                 reefs to a collective, aiming to address overfishing
                 and resource degradation by establishing fishing area
                 boundaries and limiting the number of users and usage
                 time. Technically, it is an application of TURFs, and
                 it represents a shift from traditional fishing licenses
                 to collective compliance. This experience has disrupted
                 the existing top--down fishery governance structure and
                 signifies a transition to a rights-based fishery
                 management system in China. Through a comprehensive
                 investigation and analysis of the policy's
                 implementation, this research identifies the factors
                 contributing to its flaws. These include the inadequate
                 provision of national and local government policies,
                 insufficient support for policy implementation from
                 fishery management authorities, and the limited
                 involvement of fishermen's organizations. To enhance
                 coastal fishery management, we propose that the Chinese
                 government should build upon existing foundations by
                 clarifying fishing rights through central and local
                 laws and policies. Additionally, there is a need to
                 strengthen data monitoring of coastal fisheries,
                 conduct multidisciplinary research to improve the
                 allocation mechanism of fishing rights, adopt diverse
                 fishery management approaches to enhance supervision

  abstract =     "The largemouth bronze gudgeon has experienced a sharp
                 drop in its natural population and has been listed as a
                 protected species in China. The frequent occurrence of
                 ovarian development obstruction from stage III to IV
                 has restricted artificial propagation. Due to lipids
                 being a crucial factor for ovarian development, this
                 study aimed to characterize the ovarian lipid profile
                 at different development stages in largemouth bronze
                 gudgeons. Using UPLC-MS/MS, 1353 lipids belonging to 46
                 subclasses were identified in ovaries from largemouth
                 bronze gudgeons. The results showed that glycerolipids
                 and glycerophospholipids were the dominant lipids
                 during ovarian development. Lysophosphatidyl choline
                 (LPC), phosphatidyl choline (PC), and
                 phosphatidylserine (PS), as the crucial phospholipids
                 for ovarian development, were significantly reduced
                 from stage III to IV. This may be the main cause of
                 ovarian development obstruction for largemouth bronze
                 gudgeons. Meanwhile, the enrichment analysis revealed
                 that lipid metabolites are present at different ovarian
                 development stages. Glycerophospholipid, linoleic acid,
                 and linolenic acid metabolism were significantly
                 enriched at stage IV. This study shows the complete
                 picture of the ovarian lipid composition profile, and
                 also discovers that phospholipids may be the limiting
                 factor for ovarian development; these findings offer a
                 theoretical basis for the artificial propagation and
                 release of the largemouth bronze gudgeon.",

                 broodstock technology as an alternative approach for
                 eel production. The present study aimed to evaluate
                 zebrafish and European sea bass as potential recipients
                 for European eel spermatogonia transplantation, given
                 the abundance of eel type A spermatogonia (SPGA).
                 Immature European eel testes were dissected and
                 maintained at 4 {$^\circ $}C or cryopreserved. SPGA
                 were obtained by dissociation of fresh or post-thawed
                 tissue, employing an enzymatic solution, and then
                 labelled with fluorescent membrane marker PKH26. SPGA
                 from fresh tissue were transplanted into wild-type
                 zebrafish larvae and triploid European sea bass larvae,
                 while SPGA from cryopreserved testis were transplanted
                 into vasa::egfp transgenic zebrafish larvae.
                 One-and-a-half months post-transplantation (mpt),
                 fluorescent donor cells were not detected in the gonads
                 of zebrafish or European sea bass. Molecular qPCR
                 analyses at 1.5 or 6 mpt did not reveal European

                 gonadal microenvironments of zebrafish and European sea
                 bass are unsuitable for the development of European eel

                 increased production and rearing intensities raise the

  abstract =     "Lumpfish are broadly used as biological sea lice
                 removers in Norwegian salmon farming and are mostly
                 produced in hatcheries. To date, there is little
                 systematic documentation on the mortality causes of
                 lumpfish in hatcheries. In the current study, data from
                 12 selected fish groups from four hatcheries in Norway
                 were collected to understand the challenges and
                 opportunities related to the categorization of
                 mortality causes of lumpfish in hatcheries. This study
                 indicated that a high proportion of lumpfish mortality
                 was categorized by the hatcheries as unspecified. When
                 specified, mortality was primarily assessed as due to
                 fin damage. Our analyses showed that mortality
                 categorized as fin damage correlated with the detection
                 of infectious agents in dead fish, suggesting that
                 mortality was due to infections rather than fin damage.
                 It was not possible to conclude whether infection with
                 pathogens present in the environment caused fin damage
                 or if injuries from aggression were a gateway for
                 pathogens. Furthermore, due to the lack of information
                 regarding production conditions, it was not possible to
                 assess risk factors causing eventual aggression or the
                 presence of pathogens. This study revealed that
                 mortality causality --- the chain of events leading to
                 death --- is mainly unclear in lumpfish hatcheries
                 because (1) mortality categorization does not focus on
                 underlying causes and (2) there is little documentation
                 of production conditions, making it very difficult to
                 relate mortality rates to external factors. The present
                 findings highlight that there are gaps in the
                 registrations made by hatcheries and that there is an
                 urgent need to implement standardized monitoring
                 protocols for lumpfish hatcheries. This will help
                 identify the causes of mortality and, therefore, allow
                 for the implementation of proper measures that will
                 ensure better survival.",

                 model for labyrinth fishes (Anabantoidei) adapted to
                 partial air breathing. Its reproductive endocrinology
                 has been extensively studied, and transcriptomic sex
                 differences in the gonads were described. Nevertheless,
                 sex differences in gene expression in non-gonadal
                 tissues ostensibly affected by the sex-specific
                 hormonal balance, e.g., the brain, are unknown. To
                 assess such differences, we used bulk RNA-seq to
                 assemble and compare polyA+ transcriptomes between
                 whole brains of four adult male and five adult female
                 gourami, in addition to other tissues (three dorsal fin
                 and five ovary samples) from the same female group.
                 While all nine brain transcriptomes clustered together
                 relative to the other tissues, they showed separation
                 according to sex. A total of 3568 genes were
                 differentially expressed between male and female
                 brains; of these, 1962 and 1606 showed lower and higher
                 expression in males, respectively. Male brains showed
                 stronger down-regulation of specific genes, which
                 included hormone receptors, e.g., pituitary adenylate
                 cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (pacap-r1).
                 Among the genes with lower expression in male brains,
                 multiple pathways essential to brain function were
                 over-represented, including GABA, acetylcholine and
                 glutamate receptor signaling, calcium and potassium
                 transmembrane transport, and neurogenesis. In contrast,
                 genes with higher expression in male brains showed no
                 significant over-representation of brain-specific
                 functions. To measure the mRNA levels of specific
                 hormone receptors known from prior studies to regulate
                 reproductive function and behavior in gourami and to
                 validate RNA-seq results for these specific genes, we
                 performed RT-qPCR for five receptors, pacap-r1,
                 gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 receptor (gnrh2r),
                 kisspeptin receptor 1 (gp{\alpha}r1/kiss1),
                 insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf1r), and
                 membrane progesterone receptor 1 (mpr1), in the brain
                 RNA sample groups. Of these, pacap-r1 showed a
                 significant, three-fold down-regulation, while
                 gp{\alpha}r1/kiss1 showed a significant two-fold
                 down-regulation in male vs. female gourami brains. Our
                 results are novel in describing the suppression of
                 brain function-related gene expression in male, as
                 compared to female, gourami brains. Further research is
                 needed to assess the behavioral significance of this
                 effect and its prevalence in other vertebrate groups.",

  abstract =     "A subarctic Norwegian watercourse is known for its
                 population of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus
                 aculeatus Linnaeus 1758) with unusual pelvic spine
                 polymorphism; the upper lake contains a mixture of
                 specimens that are normal-spined, asymmetric-spined,
                 and spineless. In contrast, the downstream lakes and
                 the nearby marine site contain only the normal spined
                 morph. We investigated the maternal-line genetic
                 structure in the watercourse using mitogenomics. A
                 total of 242 sticklebacks representing two lakes and a
                 marine site were assessed based on individual and
                 pooled DNA sequencing. While two distinct mitogenome
                 clades were detected in the upper lake (Lake
                 Storvatnet), only one of these clades was present in
                 the downstream lake. The marine site pooled DNA sample,
                 however, contained several mitogenome haplotypes. We
                 present mitogenome sequence features that include
                 gene-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms,
                 molecular phylogeny, and genetic differentiation
                 assessments based on pairwise comparisons of pooled
                 population samples from each site. The Lake Storvatnet
                 mitogenomes belong to two distinct Euro-North American
                 (ENA) clades; one of the ancestral lineages likely
                 corresponds to the original maternal lineage in the
                 watercourse, and the other was introduced more
                 recently. We hypothesize that the second invader
                 carried nuclear genomic features responsible for the
                 observed present-day pelvic spine polymorphism in Lake
                 Storvatnet.",

                 using HPLC with dual-channel electrochemical and UV
                 detection. The biotransformation of phenol over a range
                 of substrate concentrations (1 to 180 mM) was
                 quantified, and the Michaelis--Menten kinetics
                 constants, Km and Vmax, for the formation of
                 hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CAT), and

                 differences were noted in the Km values for Phase I
                 enzyme production of HQ and CAT, with the following
                 rank order of apparent enzyme affinity for substrate:
                 RBT {$>$} BKT = LKT. However, no apparent differences
                 in the Km for Phase II metabolism of phenol to PG were
                 detected. Conversely, while there were no apparent
                 differences in Vmax between species for HQ or CAT
                 formation, the apparent maximum capacity for PG
                 formation was significantly less in LKT than that
                 observed for RBT and BKT. These experiments provide a
                 means to quantify metabolic activation and deactivation
                 of xenobiotics in fish, to compare activation and
                 deactivation reactions across species, and to act as a
                 guide for future predictions of new chemical

                 in teleosts display high proliferative capacity
                 throughout adulthood. This study aimed to identify the
                 immunohistochemical profiles of cardiomyocytes and
                 immune cells in the hearts of Molly fish by assessing
                 the immunolabelling expression of key proteins involved
                 in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue
                 protection. The cardiac anatomy of Molly fish includes
                 the atrium, ventricle, and bulbus arteriosus. The
                 expression of SOX9, NF-{\kappa}B, myostatin, and S100
                 proteins in myocardial cells indicates the
                 proliferative features of the heart in Molly fish. The
                 bulbus arteriosus is characterized by collagenous
                 chambers and smooth muscle cells that express Ach and
                 iba1. The atrium of Molly fish serves as a storage unit
                 for rodlet cells and immune cells. Rodlet cells
                 displayed immunoreactivity to NF-{\kappa}B, iba1,

                 telocytes (TCs) have emerged as a significant component
                 of the atrium of Molly fish, expressing Ach, CD68, S100

                 involvement of TCs in multiple signaling pathways that
                 contribute to heart architecture. This study delineates

  abstract =     "Fish stocks are declining in marine capture coastal
                 fisheries in West Africa. Many observers have blamed
                 climate change and the system of open access for the
                 decline. Open-access fishing encourages too many people
                 to take up fishing, and the result is overfishing of
                 the stocks. According to such critics, this is a
                 classic example of Hardin's tragedy of the commons,
                 whereby a continuous increase in the number of users of
                 a natural resource eventually leads to the collapse of
                 the resource. The present study, which analysed
                 stakeholders' perceptions about their open-access
                 fishing in Siera Leone's marine fisheries, conducted 32
                 key informant interviews. Our research found that while
                 they perceived that open-access fishing impacted fish
                 stocks, most Sierra Leone's marine capture fishers did
                 not see open access as a cause of fish decline;
                 instead, they blamed the lack of enforced regulations
                 on the methods and extent of fishing. Accordingly,
                 these fishers favoured the continuation of open access
                 --- not least because it helps to alleviate hunger and
                 is a readily available source of protein in Sierra
                 Leone's coastal communities --- but accompanied by
                 strict regulations on both the type of fishing gear
                 used and the quantity, size, and species of fish
                 caught. In other words, they preferred regulated open
                 access to unregulated open access. The central
                 government's resolve to regulate its fishery will
                 determine whether it will transition from unregulated
                 open access to regulated open access or other forms of
                 OA. This study recommends detailed research into how to
                 influence political will to enforce regulations.",

                 characteristics and changes in Poyang Lake after the
                 Yangtze River fishing ban in 2021, seven sampling
                 stations were established, namely in Hukou, Lushan,
                 Duchang, Yongxiu, Nanjishan, Ruihong, and Poyang, for
                 fishery resource surveys between 2020 and 2021. The
                 results showed that 93 fish species were identified,
                 belonging to 11 orders, 20 families, and 61 genera,
                 which was an increase of 4.5\% from before the fishing
                 ban. Of these, 52 Cyprinidae species were identified,
                 comprising the highest proportion (55.91\%). Four
                 invasive alien species (hybrid sturgeon, Cirrhina
                 mrigala, Piaractus brachypomus, and Mugil cephalus)
                 were identified, and the number of alien species in
                 Poyang Lake was higher than before the fishing ban.
                 Carnivorous and mid-lower-level fish showed a
                 significant increase, accounting for 47.31\% and
                 38.71\% of the total species, respectively. Compared
                 with the Yangtze River before the fishing ban, the body
                 length and body weight of the main economic fish in
                 Poyang Lake increased by 6.10--61.26\% and by
                 15.14--291.57\%, respectively. In terms of age
                 structure, the proportion of major economically
                 important fish aged 1 or 2 years decreased
                 significantly, while the proportion of older fish
                 increased substantially. There was little difference in
                 the diversity of fish communities at different stations
                 in Poyang Lake. In terms of biodiversity, the
                 Shannon--Wiener index ranged from 2.158 to 2.909, with
                 Poyang having the highest value and Nanjishan the
                 lowest. Margalef's index ranged from 4.265 to 6.459,
                 with Lushan having the highest value and Nanjishan the
                 lowest. Pielou's index ranged from 0.617 to 0.822, with
                 Duchang having the highest value and Nanjishan the
                 lowest. Hence, the Yangtze river fishing ban has played
                 an important and positive role in the restoration of
                 fishery resources in Poyang Lake. However, long-term
                 tracking and monitoring are needed to provide
                 information to comprehensively evaluate the ecological
                 impact of the Poyang Lake fishing ban.",

                 distribution range. Documenting how behaviors vary at
                 fringes in comparison to core habitats is key to
                 understanding the impact of environmental variation and
                 the evolution of local adaptations. Here, we studied
                 the behavior of Wels catfish (Silurus glanis) in Lake
                 M{\"o}ckeln, Sweden, which represent a European
                 northern fringe population. Adult individuals (101--195
                 cm, N = 55) were caught and externally marked with data
                 storage tags (DSTs). Fifteen DSTs were recovered a year
                 after tagging, of which 11 tags contained long-term
                 high-resolution behavioral data on the use of vertical
                 (depth) and thermal habitats. This showed that the
                 catfish already became active in late winter ({$<$5}
                 {$^\circ $}C) and displayed nocturnal activity
                 primarily during summer and late autumn. The latter
                 included a transition from the bottom to the surface
                 layer at dusk, continuous and high activity close to
                 the surface during the night, and then descent back to
                 deeper water at dawn. During the daytime, the catfish

                 histopathological lesions caused by acute infection
                 with two serotypes of S. agalactiae. For this, two
                 strains isolated from natural outbreaks in Brazilian
                 aquaculture farms (S13, serotype Ib; S73, serotype III)
                 were used to challenge juvenile Nile tilapia (
                 Oreochromis niloticus) intraperitoneally. Target organ
                 samples were collected ten times, between 1 and 96 h
                 post-infection, for microbiological and
                 histopathological analyses. Anorexia was the first
                 clinical sign and the first death occurred at 24 and 30
                 h in the fish infected with strains S13 and S73,
                 respectively. Serotype Ib initially caused more
                 pronounced lesions in the nervous system; however,
                 serotype III lesions progressed more aggressively,
                 reaching the same severity as those of serotype Ib.
                 This trend was repeated in the mortality curve after 32
                 h. These results elucidated the important stages in the

                 fishing in Greece's inland waters, where recent years
                 have witnessed a notable surge in such activities.
                 Despite the absence of official records, insights into
                 the sport's trend and the motivations and
                 socio-demographic characteristics of anglers
                 participating in fishing competitions were gleaned from
                 digital data sourced from online platforms and
                 interviews with anglers. Our findings illuminate the
                 growing popularity of sport fishing in Greece, evident
                 in the increasing number of fishing competitions and
                 the burgeoning angling community. Predominantly male,
                 anglers exhibit a strong dedication to
                 catch-and-release practices, citing relaxation and
                 socialization as primary motivations, with competitive
                 aspirations also shaping their involvement. Moreover,
                 the study highlights legislative gaps in inland water

  abstract =     "Mesopelagic fishes hold an important position in
                 marine food webs, serving as a link between lower
                 trophic levels and top predators and transferring
                 energy from their deep mesopelagic habitat to shallower
                 oceanic layers. Despite their ecological importance,
                 research on mesopelagic fishes' diet and feeding habits
                 in the Mediterranean Sea is far from thorough. The
                 present work attempts to assess the preying patterns
                 and diet composition of four myctophid (Benthosema
                 glaciale, Ceratoscopelus maderensis, Myctophum
                 punctatum,~Notoscopelus~elongatus) and two
                 sternoptychid (Argyropelecus hemigymnus,~Maurolicus
                 muelleri) species from the Corinthian Gulf (Ionian Sea,
                 Greece), sampled during pelagic trawl surveys in 2018
                 and 2019. Stomach vacuity was high for myctophids
                 caught during daytime, a pattern which sternoptychids
                 did not follow. Estimated trophic indices revealed high
                 dietary diversity (Shannon's H ' index) for most
                 investigated species, but a narrow trophic niche
                 breadth (Levins' normalized B n index). Copepods and
                 various marine crustaceans were dominant in all diets,
                 classifying them under the zooplanktivorous trophic
                 guild, while A. hemigymnus exhibited high
                 concentrations of particulate organic matter in their
                 stomachs and N. elongatus exhibited consumption of
                 fish. Diet overlap was significant among most studied
                 mesopelagic species, as indicated by Shoener's S index
                 and confirmed by both the multidimensional scaling
                 ordination and a hierarchical cluster analysis.
                 Information on mesopelagic fishes' diet composition in
                 this poorly studied part of the Mediterranean is useful
                 in further assessing and parameterizing marine food

  abstract =     "As a member of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)
                 class, scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) plays a
                 key role in innate immunity. Grass carp (
                 Ctenopharyngodon idellus) ranks among the most
                 extensively cultivated freshwater aquaculture species
                 in China. However, little is known about the function
                 of SRB1 in C. idellus. In this research study, a SRB1
                 gene was identified in C.~idellus, named CiSRB1. The
                 full-length cDNA of CiSRB1 is 2486 bp long, with an
                 open reading frame (ORF) of 2486 bp encoding a 497
                 amino acid (aa) protein containing a conserved CD36
                 domain. The identified genomic DNA length of CiSRB1 is
                 20,042 bp, including 12 exons and 11 introns. The
                 predictive analysis of protein interactions revealed
                 that Ci SRB1 could interact with the outer capsid
                 proteins of typical GCRV strains. The tissue
                 distribution of CiSRB1 exhibited age-dependent
                 characteristics. CiSRB1 displayed the highest
                 expression in the intestines and moderate levels in
                 muscle, spleen, liver, and brain of one-year-old grass
                 carp while maintaining relatively low levels in
                 three-year-old grass carp. Following grass carp
                 reovirus (GCRV) infection, notable upregulation of
                 CiSRB1 transcripts was observed in major immune tissues
                 (gills, intestines, spleen, and liver). Furthermore,
                 significant differences were found between one-year-old
                 and three-year-old grass carp, with lower CiSRB1
                 expression levels being detected in the older group.
                 Additionally, a distinct response to GCRV infection was
                 observed in one-year-old and three-year-old grass carp.
                 It was found that one-year-old individuals had a
                 mortality rate of up to 84\% 6 days post-infection
                 (dpi), whereas all three-year-old counterparts survived
                 after GCRV infection. The analysis of GCRV copy numbers
                 across tissues revealed substantially higher levels in
                 one-year-old grass carp compared with their older
                 counterparts, confirming the existence of age-dependent
                 susceptibility to GCRV infection in grass carp.
                 Combined with these results, it was speculated that the
                 decline in cell-surface CiSRB1 expression with age may
                 impede reovirus binding to host cells, potentially
                 explaining why older grass carp demonstrated enhanced
                 resistance to GCRV infection. This observation
                 accentuates the importance of CiSRB1 in the context of
                 GCRV infection and provides insights into age-dependent
                 susceptibility to reovirus.",

  abstract =     "Wild fish are preferred by consumers primarily for
                 their superior sensorial qualities, including taste and
                 texture. However, their limited availability often
                 results in higher prices. Considering this, we explored
                 the possibility of enhancing the quality of earthen
                 pond aquaculture fish by transferring them to a near
                 wild environment. This study investigated how rewilding
                 time affects the physical properties, nutritional
                 composition, and volatile profile of grass carp muscle.
                 The results showed that compared to the 0M group, the
                 crude protein content in grass carp muscle did not
                 change significantly (p {$>$} 0.05) as the rewilding
                 time increased to 6 months. Meanwhile, the significant
                 increase in hardness and springiness (p {$<$} 0.05)
                 indicated that the textural characteristics of muscle,
                 which were key sensory and physical indices of muscle
                 quality, were improved. Although the 6M group showed a
                 58.93\% reduction in crude fat content compared to the
                 0M group, it retained the highest docosahexaenoic acid
                 (DHA) content. Sensory evaluation demonstrated that as
                 the rewilding time increased, the fishy and grassy
                 odors of the rewilding grass carp diminished.
                 Furthermore, cluster heatmaps and partial least squares
                 discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that cultured
                 grass carp and rewilding grass carp at three time
                 points exhibited differences in various indicators. The
                 variable importance in projection (VIP) showed that
                 volatile flavor compounds (acetone, propionaldehyde-D,
                 1-penten-3-ol) and hardness were key factors in
                 distinguishing between them. Therefore, extending the
                 rewilding time can potentially enhance the
                 acceptability of cultured grass carp by improving the
                 physical properties, nutritional quality, and volatile
                 profile of the muscle. This approach may provide a new
                 pathway for fish aquaculture.",

                 metals (HMs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
                 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other
                 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in fish, water,
                 and sediments of the Black Sea, and their implications
                 for marine ecosystem health and human safety. Data were
                 collected through scientific cruises and the
                 methodology involved systematic sampling across
                 different regions of the Romanian Black Sea, followed
                 by rigorous laboratory analyses to identify and
                 quantify the presence of contaminants. The study also
                 examined the temporal trends of these pollutants,
                 providing insights into their sources, pathways, and
                 persistence in the marine environment. Additionally,
                 the research assessed the bioaccumulation of
                 contaminants in various biota, offering a critical
                 perspective on food safety and potential risks to human
                 consumers. The findings revealed significant spatial
                 insights, highlighting areas of concern that require
                 immediate attention and action. Notably, industrial
                 discharge, agricultural runoff, and historical
                 pollution hotspots were identified as major sources of
                 contamination. This research underscores the need for
                 enhanced monitoring and regulatory frameworks to
                 mitigate pollution sources and safeguard the Black Sea
                 ecosystem, advocating for sustainable practices and
                 effective management strategies to preserve marine
                 resources in the Black Sea.",

                 lice in finfish aquaculture can disperse into the
                 marine habitat and have the potential to affect
                 non-target species like crustaceans. Some of the
                 compounds used (especially in Canada) include in-feed
                 drugs such as emamectin benzoate (EMB), and ivermectin
                 (IVER), as well as bath pesticides such as azamethiphos
                 (AZA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP). Despite the paucity
                 of data, crustacean life cycle stages appear to have
                 varying sensitivities to these compounds. This data
                 review sets out to examine the intraspecies variation
                 in sensitivity within life stages for lobster (Homarus
                 ) and prawn (Pandalus) species. Despite limited
                 information, it appears that prawn eggs, adults, and
                 juveniles are less sensitive to AZA and EMB compared
                 with larvae, whereas for lobster the opposite is true:
                 adults and juveniles are more sensitive than larvae to
                 AZA (there was insufficient data to assess EMB). For
                 HP, the sensitivity of prawn eggs appears comparable to
                 larvae, but hatching success data suggest that this
                 important stage of development is less impacted than
                 eggs themselves as indicated by one study. These
                 differences are important considerations for toxicity
                 threshold determination processes and risk assessments,
                 which ideally are environmentally relevant, and
                 highlight the need for more data.",

                 energy metabolism of wild Amur grayling (Thymallus
                 grubii). Swimming performance was assessed by measuring
                 critical swimming speed (U crit), burst speed (U
                 burst), and oxygen consumption rate (MO 2) based on the
                 stepped velocity test method. Our results showed that
                 the absolute values of U crit and U burst tended to
                 increase with body length. In contrast, the relative
                 values of U crit and U burst tended to decrease and
                 increase, respectively. MO 2 in Amur grayling was
                 elevated with increasing velocity, suggesting
                 relatively high swimming efficiency. We also measured
                 the biochemical indices related to energy metabolism.
                 Lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, and pyruvate kinase

                 comprehensive project (BIOACID) addressing the
                 physiological resilience of Polar cod, Boreogadus
                 saida, to ocean acidification and global warming and
                 aimed to unravel underlying molecular mechanisms of the
                 observed physiological responses. Methods: Fish were
                 acclimated long-term to three CO 2 concentrations
                 comprising control conditions (390 ppm) and two
                 projected climate scenarios (780 ppm and 1170 ppm).
                 Each CO 2 treatment was combined with four
                 temperatures: 0, 3, 6, and 8 {$^\circ $}C. Here, we
                 focused on the hepatic transcriptomic profiles from
                 these previously physiologically characterized fish.
                 Results: Generally, we did not detect signs of a
                 classical stress response. Consistent with functional
                 observations, warming induced much stronger molecular
                 responses compared to elevated P CO 2, but an
                 interaction between both factors existed to some
                 extent. Gene ontology analysis revealed a strong
                 response in lipid, amino acid, and protein metabolism.
                 With increasing temperature, we observed a shift away
                 from lipid metabolism, while carbohydrate metabolic
                 pathways remained stable. Conclusions: Although we
                 found Polar cod to be quite resilient to ocean
                 acidification, temperature will remain a critical
                 parameter for this valuable Arctic keystone species,
                 and the question remains as to whether the observed
                 acclimation strategies can be implemented in its
                 natural habitat, especially when food supply is
                 limited.",

                 Angelshark S. oculata Bonaye, 1840, Sawback Angelshark
                 S. aculeata Cuvier, 1829, and Angelshark S. squatina
                 (Linnaeus, 1758). The supporting data serves to
                 highlight three potential Critical Angel Shark Areas
                 (CASAs) in T{\"u}rkiye: Fethiye Bay, {\c{C}}anakkale
                 Strait (i.e., Dardanelles), and Antalya Bay. These data
                 also demonstrate that female S. oculata may mature at a
                 smaller size than prior published estimates of length
                 at first maturity. This new dataset provides details of
                 23 S. squatina specimens, 52 S. oculata specimens, and
                 5 S. aculeata specimens, totalling 80 recent angel
                 shark specimens found in Turkish waters mostly sent to
                 us from small-scale fishers who had incidentally caught
                 angel sharks. Also presented are four capture-induced
                 parturition events in Turkish waters onboard fishing
                 vessels, thus providing details on internal yolk sacs,
                 reproductive habitats, and indications of spawning
                 season. Our dataset presented here spans from 2018 to
                 2023 and suggests that mature adults of S. squatina and
                 S. oculata still occur in Turkish waters, in Fethiye
                 Bay and {\c{C}}anakkale, respectively. Due to elevated
                 chances of fishers encountering Critically Endangered
                 angel sharks in T{\"u}rkiye, we suggest that fishers
                 are trained in handling and safe-release methods, to
                 ensure reduced incidents of capture-induced
                 parturition, and improved post-release survival. This
                 study demonstrates that bottom set nets set by
                 small-scale fishers pose less risk to mortality for
                 angel sharks as they are almost always encountered
                 alive after a usual 12 h soak time, suggesting that
                 bottom trawling in critical habitats should be better
                 regulated (or phased out) to help improve national
                 angel shark conservation initiatives.",

                 moderate-to-severe pain, elicits its actions by binding
                 to the opioid receptors. Cocaine is an example of a
                 recreational drug that inhibits dopamine reuptake. The
                 molecular effects of morphine and cocaine have been
                 described in different specific brain regions. However,
                 the systemic outcome of these drugs on the whole
                 organism has not been fully addressed. The aim of this
                 study is to analyse the global effects of morphine (10
                 {\mu}M) and cocaine (15 {\mu}M) in the expression of
                 proteins related to the reward pathway. Zebrafish
                 embryos were exposed to these drugs from 5 hpf (hours
                 post-fertilisation) to 6 dpf (days post-fertilisation).
                 Dopamine levels were determined by ELISA, and the
                 expression of Fos proteins, Creb, its activated form
                 p-Creb and tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) were examined by
                 Western blot. Both drugs decreased Th levels at 72 hpf
                 and 6 dpf and modified the expression of Fos family
                 members, pCreb and Creb in a time-dependent manner.
                 Morphine and cocaine exposure differentially modified
                 dopamine levels in 72 hpf and 6 dpf zebrafish embryos.
                 Our results indicate that drugs of abuse modify the
                 expression of several proteins and molecules related to
                 the activation of the reward pathway.",

                 promoting the high quality and sustainable development
                 of the marine fishery economy. Based on the panel data
                 of the digital economy and marine fishery development
                 from 2011 to 2022, we firstly adopted the entropy
                 method to comprehensively evaluate the economy quality
                 level of the digital economy and marine fishing.
                 Secondly, we constructed a two-way fixed effect model
                 to empirically analyze the impact of digital economy
                 development on the marine fishery economy quality and
                 the mediating role of marine green science and
                 technology innovation, and further explored the
                 regional heterogeneity of the digital economy on the
                 marine fishery economy quality. Several findings
                 emerge. The digital economy and the marine fishery
                 economy quality level was relatively low and showed a
                 fluctuating increase. The development of the digital
                 economy can significantly improve the economy quality
                 of marine fishing, and the conclusion was still valid
                 after considering a series of robustness tests. The
                 digital economy can drive the development quality of
                 the marine fishery economy through marine green
                 technology innovation. This paper proposes fostering
                 the advancement of digital technology in the marine
                 fishery sector, to effectively harness the
                 innovation-driven potential of the digital economy, so

                 (GnRH) and gonadotropin (GtH) within the
                 brain--pituitary--gonad (BPG) axis in eels with
                 undeveloped ovaries were investigated through in vivo

                 only became apparent during ovary development in the

                 feedback regulation of the BPG axis, female Anguilla
                 japonica underwent artificial induction of
                 vitellogenesis, and the regulation of BPG axis tissues
                 by GtH (human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG), E2, and T
                 was explored through in vitro exposure. The mRNA

                 and ovary, respectively, were determined. The results
                 showed that the expression level of mGnRH in the
                 diencephalon was significantly downregulated by 0.1
                 IU/mL hCG but upregulated by both 1 nM E2 and higher
                 concentrations of T, suggesting a direct positive
                 feedback regulation of E2 on mGnRH. In the pituitary,
                 the expression levels of fshb and lhb were upregulated
                 by E2, while fshb was suppressed by T. In the ovaries,
                 the expression of cyp11a1 and hsd3b was upregulated by
                 1 nM E2, whereas T exposure resulted in an opposite
                 effect. Cyp17a1 mRNA levels did not differ
                 significantly with E2 treatment but were upregulated by
                 1 nM T. These findings suggest that low concentrations
                 of E2 exhibited positive feedback regulation on all
                 three levels (diencephalon, pituitary, and ovary) of
                 the BPG axis, while T showed weaker and differential
                 feedback regulation in BPG axis tissues. Overall, this
                 study's results revealed the direct feedback regulation

                 are currently looking for potential beneficial bacteria

                 bacterial communities in the gastrointestinal tract of
                 wild spiny lobsters. The gastrointestinal (GI) tracts
                 of two wild lobster species (Panulirus ornatus and
                 Panulirus homarus) were dissected aseptically and
                 analyzed through high-throughput sequencing, followed
                 by PICRUSt analysis. The results exposed that the most
                 dominant phyla inhabiting both lobster species at the
                 post-puerulus and juvenile stages were Proteobacteria,
                 Firmicutes, Bacteriodota, Patescibacteria, and
                 Verrucomicrobiota, while at the genus level, the GI
                 tracts were mostly dominated by Photobacterium,
                 Candidatus Bacillopora, Vibrio, and Catenococcus at the
                 post-peurulus stage, and Vibrio, Catenococcus,
                 Acanthopleuribacter, Acinetobacter, Pseudoalteromonas,
                 Grimontia, and Photobacterium at the juvenile stage.
                 Further metagenomic prediction analysis discovers many
                 potential probiont properties indicated by the
                 detection of marker genes corresponding to many
                 important metabolic activities, such as antimicrobial
                 compounds (streptomycin, vancomycin, carbapenem,
                 tetracycline, novobiocin, penicillin, cephalosporin,
                 ansamycines, butirosin, and neomycin), antioxidants
                 (e.g., flavonoids and carotenoids), and several
                 important digestive enzymes (e.g., lipase, protease,
                 and amylase). These results suggest that GI tracts of
                 wild spiny lobsters are potential sources to discover

                 studies, such as the isolation of the natural
                 product-producing bacteria, or cloning of the
                 beneficial compound-identified genes, are highly
